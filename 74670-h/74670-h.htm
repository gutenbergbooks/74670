<p class="center">UNDER THE GREENWOOD-TREE.</p>


<p>“How on earth did you get up there?” And the
speaker put his glass in his eye, and coolly surveyed the
dainty figure perched on one of the branches of the huge
elm, under which he was standing. “That is the last
place I expected to find you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” she answered composedly; for Lady
Gwendolyn was never flustered or ill at ease under the
most trying circumstances. “The fact is, I have had
an unpleasant adventure.”</p>

<p>“Indeed; I am very sorry. But hadn’t you better let
me help you down before we talk it over; unless you
like your quarters so well that you are inclined to stay
there, and, in that case, I will join you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Colonel Dacre!” but she laughed, too.
“What would Mrs. Grundy say to such an extraordinary
tête-à-tête?”</p>

<p>“She would say that it had the merit of novelty; and,
considering how tired one is of everything that has happened,
and how bored at the thought of prospective repetitions,
I consider that any one who strikes out a new line
for himself, and refuses to lag along in the old groove,
deserves to be canonized.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is very nice when people will be a little original,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
certainly; but I am not sure that a woman dare get
out of the old groove. Moreover, you men like pretty
nonentities.”</p>

<p>“The deuce we do!” exclaimed Colonel Dacre. “Who
told you that?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. One does not need telling things when
one has eyes and ears. I have seen you dance as often
as four times in one evening with Mrs. O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well,” echoed Lady Gwendolyn, with a superb sort
of insolence, “is she clever?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Refined?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Colonel Dacre again.</p>

<p>“Or particularly good?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it that makes her the most popular
woman in London?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I can’t tell you. I like her because
I knew poor O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“And is it so pleasant to talk to her of your dead
friend?” insinuated Lady Gwendolyn slyly.</p>

<p>“I never heard her mention her husband’s name in my
life.”</p>

<p>“No? Really, you quite astonish me! Then you can’t
like her for his sake—you must like her for her own.
And I will tell you why, shall I?”</p>

<p>“I am all attention.”</p>

<p>“Well, she flatters you so skilfully that you don’t even
know she is doing it, at the same time that you feel infinitely
satisfied with yourself. I don’t mean you, individually,
Colonel Dacre; but her acquaintances generally.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, no one can accuse you of a like fault,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Lady Gwendolyn,” he said, with a faint smile, that showed
pain as well as amusement.</p>

<p>“No; I am perfectly downright—too much so, Lady
Teignmouth says; but then there is one thing I would
scorn to do.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” And there was a certain eagerness
in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>“I would scorn to trouble the peace of a happy ménage
for the sake of gratifying my poor vanity.”</p>

<p>“And who does this thing?”</p>

<p>“You have a very poor memory, Colonel Dacre. Don’t
you remember how well poor foolish Percy Gray got on
with his wife, until——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” he urged.</p>

<p>“Well, until Mrs. O’Hara paid them a long visit in
town, and then Percy began gradually to discover that
Lady Maria was unsympathetic and dull, and could not
satisfy a man of intellectual tastes. Perhaps Mrs. O’Hara
meant no worse than to make herself agreeable to a convenient
acquaintance; but the result was to separate the
two.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are just, Lady Gwendolyn. What
reason have you for laying their domestic differences at
Mrs. O’Hara’s door?”</p>

<p>“Lady Maria made no mystery of it.”</p>

<p>“She was jealous of Mrs. O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. I fancy I should have been in her place,”
and Lady Gwendolyn’s eyes flashed fire. “If I had a
husband, I should not exactly care for him to be always
dancing attendance on a handsome widow, and making
her presents of valuable jewels, especially when he bought
these last with my money.”</p>

<p>“Did Lady Maria tell you that, too?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she did, and ‘albeit though not given to the
melting mood,’ I cried with her, poor thing! ‘For,’ as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
pathetically said, ‘we were so happy together, Percy and
I, until Mrs. O’Hara came to stay with us in town, and
then she gave him such an exalted idea of himself that
I could not please or satisfy him afterward.’”</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence. Lady Gwendolyn was
almost ashamed at the warmth she had shown, lest her
motives should be misconstrued; and Colonel Dacre was
meditating deeply. At last he looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Why do you tell me all this, Lady Gwendolyn? You
are not a spiteful woman naturally, and I know you to
be incapable of jealousy. For these reasons I am specially
anxious to understand your meaning.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess?”</p>

<p>“No; unless you fancy I am in danger from Mrs.
O’Hara’s attractions, and need warning.”</p>

<p>“I have been afraid so,” she said; and the wild-rose
bloom of her soft cheeks deepened to a rich crimson.
“And we have been friends so long, neighbors always, I
could not bear to see you throw yourself away on a woman
who was so infinitely unworthy of an honest man’s
love.”</p>

<p>If Lady Gwendolyn had been near Colonel Dacre she
would not have dared to speak so frankly. But her position,
if ridiculous, had its advantages, for she was out
of the range of his keen glances, and the tremulous leaves
had the benefit of her frequent blushes. For over a
month now she had been longing to tell him this, but
the courage had only come to-day. She was quite obliged
to Farmer Bates’ bull for having frightened her up into
the tree, and she did not mean to descend just yet.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre took a long time to digest her warning,
but he spoke at last coolly enough.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lady Gwendolyn; but though I don’t quite
agree with you about Mrs. O’Hara, I would sooner shoot
myself than marry her. My friend was a noble fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and kept his counsel bravely to the end; but there was
one thing that would always prevent me from falling
in love with his widow.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Because I should not like to stand in a dead man’s
shoes, especially his. So, you see, I am safe, although
Mrs. O’Hara has the double advantages of being a nonentity
and a flatterer. Now will you let me help you down
from your perch?”</p>

<p>“Wait just one minute. I want to ask you a very impertinent
question first, if I may.”</p>

<p>“I grant you absolution beforehand,” he said, smiling,
“on condition that you do not keep me in suspense.”</p>

<p>“I want to know,” she began hesitatingly, “whether if—supposing
Mrs. O’Hara had not been your friend’s
widow——”</p>

<p>“I should have cared for her?” put in the colonel, to
help out her halting speech. “Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am so absurdly curious, and I have always
wondered if—if——”</p>

<p>Here she came to a full stop in dire confusion, for she
had been going to add, “if that is the sort of woman you
would care for;” and suddenly perceived that this would
not do at all.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer your question when you are on terra
firma,” replied Colonel Dacre, dodging to catch a glimpse
of the piquant face among the leaves; “this is what I
call a conversation under difficulties. By the by, you forgot
to tell me why you got up there at all.”</p>

<p>“Bates’ bull put its head over the railing, and looked at
my red cloak so viciously I dared not pass him. I had
often climbed this tree with Reggie when I was a little
girl, and had managed to give Fraulein von Linder the
slip; and so I thought I would try it again to-day; but a
gown with a train is embarrassing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“I expect it is,” he answered, with a droll look in his
handsome eyes. “I should be sorry to go about the
world crippled by my clothes as you women do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t mind it, as a rule. One would rather
suffer anything, you know, than be quite out of the
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Would one, indeed?” he returned, in a tone of grave
commiseration. “It seems to me that fashion is the greatest
despot the world ever knew; but I am thankful to say
it is only women who yield so servilely to its exactions.”</p>

<p>“Of course. One never hears, for instance, of men
putting their necks into a vise, and having to turn their
heads painfully for fear of accidents to the machinery.
Still, if we did hear of such things, we should know it
was only done for comfort, and respect them vastly for
consulting their own ease before appearances.”</p>

<p>“I can’t argue with a lady so high above me,” retorted
Colonel Dacre; and then he added, more seriously: “Indeed,
Lady Gwendolyn, you ought to come down. I can
see the Handley drag in the distance, and you know Sir
Charles would tease your life out of you if he caught
you in such a predicament as this.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he would, and therefore I must return to
conventional life again. But you have no idea how pleasant
it is up here; the air is so pure, and the leaves smell
so sweet. I’ll get Teignmouth to arrange me a little place
in one of his big trees, à la Robinson, so that I may retire
there for contemplation and self-examination occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Or, rather, say to read your <i>billets doux</i>, and keep a
close calculation as to the number of hearts you have
broken,” said Colonel Dacre, with a sternness in his voice
that showed this trifling, butterfly nature—as he believed
it to be—angered as well as charmed him. “I fancy that
would be nearer the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Without answering him, Lady Gwendolyn began to
work her way slowly along the bough on which she had
been seated. She found it a very different performance
in cold blood from what it had been under the excitement
of fear, and felt herself tremble nervously.</p>

<p>She was terribly incommoded by her dress into the
bargain. If Colonel Dacre had not been there she would
have gathered her train over her arm, and let her ankles
take their chance; but under the circumstances this would
not have done, and she had to proceed circumspectly, as
became the daughter of a hundred earls.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of her difficulties, and seeing the
Handley drag draw nearer and nearer, Colonel Dacre
kept urging her on eagerly. Sir Charles was a great
gossip, and it was quite as well he should not have
an opportunity of making mischief out of Lady Gwendolyn’s
escapade.</p>

<p>“You really must be quick,” he urged; “the horses are
turning Borton corner.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think I should pass unobserved if you
were to get away from the tree?” observed Lady Gwendolyn
timidly.</p>

<p>“Impossible. Your red cloak must have been a feature
in the landscape for some time past. You had better leave
it where it is, to account for what they have seen, and
if you are very quick, we shall be able to hide ourselves
before they get on high ground again.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well, but——”</p>

<p>“Shall I give you a little help?”</p>

<p>“Not for worlds! I would rather stay here all night.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I know you are laughing at me in your
sleeve. You did not see the bull’s great glaring eyes.”</p>

<p>“If you had made him a present of your cloak he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
have been so taken up with his toy that you would have
been able to make your escape in a legitimate way.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well, but I really can’t afford to throw
my clothes away in that fashion. I have come down to
Teignmouth on purpose to economize, because I exceeded
my allowance last year, and my brother had to help me
through. Now he is married he has to pay his wife’s
debts, and, of course, I am left out in the cold; so I am
obliged to be horribly careful, you see. Teignmouth says
I ought to make three hundred pounds a year do; but then
you men never understand what heaps of things a woman
wants.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” groaned her listener. “A man must have
ten thousand pounds nowadays before he can afford the
luxury of a wife, and then he’s ruined half the time. But
pray look where you are going, Lady Gwendolyn. I am
sure that branch on which you are stepping is rotten and
unsafe.”</p>

<p>“It bore me before.”</p>

<p>“And, therefore, is less likely to do so again. I can hear
it crack now—for mercy’s sake step back!” he shouted, in
a frightened tone.</p>

<p>She seemed to enjoy his alarm, and laughed defiantly.
She desired nothing better than to make him suffer a little;
and she saw, by his anxious face, that he was suffering
now—from a nervous dread of witnessing some
catastrophe, no doubt. She put her other foot onto the
rotten branch. He was watching her with his heart in
his eyes; but he saw that his warning had been a mistake,
and was silent now, hoping she would try to redeem
her error if she were left to herself.</p>

<p>And so she did; but it was too late. The bough gave a
loud creak, then broke off suddenly, and Lady Gwendolyn
fell in a brilliant heap at Colonel Dacre’s feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The red cloak, her pretty summer hat, and her long
black hair, were all in such a tangle together that he
could not find her face at first, and even when he did
he was afraid to look, lest the fatal beauty, which had
been the curse of so many, was all spoiled and disfigured.
An unholy thought sped through him, that, if it were so,
there would be none to dispute with him the treasure he
coveted. But he chased this away with contumely.</p>

<p>With a quick but reluctant hand he swept away the
shining masses of her hair, and looked at her anxiously.
She was as white as a lily; but if there was no more harm
done than what he saw, she would break many more
hearts yet—his own maybe among the rest.</p>

<p>He bent his lips almost to her ear; inhaling, with passionate
delight, the faint perfume that pervaded her dress.</p>

<p>So far it had been a wonderful privilege to hold her
hand for a few seconds in his; and now he might have
touched her creamy cheek with his lips had he been so
minded, and no one would have been the wiser, for the
Handley wagonette had gone by, and there was not a
living soul in sight.</p>

<p>It was a great temptation, for he had loved this girl
secretly, madly, entirely, for two long years, and had
suffered tortures of jealousy and hopelessness meanwhile.</p>

<p>If she would only come to herself! He did not think
she could be much injured, as she had not fallen from
any great height, but still she did not open her eyes, and
he was so totally inexperienced in fainting-fits, that her
perfect immovability frightened him.</p>

<p>He almost wished now that he had hailed the Handley
people as they went by, although he was so jealously glad
to have her all to himself. He wondered what he ought
to do. He had heard of eau de Cologne being an excellent
thing under the circumstance, but then he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
carry it about with him. He put his hand in his pocket
mechanically as the idea occurred to him, and came upon
his silver hunting-flask. His face brightened at once.
He was sure he had also heard of brandy as a remedy,
and what a merciful thing he had some by him. He
supposed it was to be applied externally, like the eau de
Cologne. Going down on his knees beside the insensible
figure, he moistened his handkerchief with the spirit,
and then bathed Lady Gwendolyn’s forehead and nostrils;
and whether it was that brandy so applied really was a
good thing, or that the fainting-fits was ending naturally,
the girl’s white eyelids began to twinkle, and suddenly
she looked up at him with a languidly mysterious smile.</p>

<p>He stooped over her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Are you better, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“Have I been ill, then?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no!” he answered cheerfully, having always
understood that you must keep your patient’s spirits
up. “Just a little faintness, that was all. Nothing of the
smallest consequence.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” she returned. “I believe I
have broken my leg.”</p>

<p>“Oh! pray, don’t say that. You only fell from a very
short distance, after all, and your feet were not doubled
under you, or anything of that sort. You don’t feel any
pain, do you?”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn shook her dark, disheveled head in a
despondent way.</p>

<p>“That is what I do feel, and I am sure I could not walk
home.”</p>

<p>“I never dreamed of your doing such a thing. If you
don’t mind waiting here——”</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>“So close to Bates’ bull?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said penitently, and then stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
pulling at his mustache—a way he had when puzzled
or annoyed.</p>

<p>At last he added hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“My house is close here, and if you would not mind
my carrying you there, Mrs. Whittaker, the housekeeper,
would be able to attend to you until the doctor came. I
cannot think of any better plan at this moment; and, of
course, I shall not enter the Hall until I have fetched
Lady Teignmouth. It is ridiculous to trouble about conventionalities
at such a time, Lady Gwendolyn, when the
least neglect or delay might cause you to be a cripple
for life. Are you not of my opinion?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” she replied, with a strange gleam as of suppressed
triumph in her beautiful eyes. “Only that I am
afraid you will find that the burden laid upon you is
heavier than you can bear.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” he said, lifting her in his stalwart arms
as easily as if she had been a child. “Would you mind
putting your arm round my shoulder, just to steady yourself?”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn obeyed him with the simplicity that is
always such perfect breeding; and when Colonel Dacre
looked down at the creamy cheek resting on his shoulder,
and felt the warm coil of her arm round his neck, he
could hardly resist the mad temptation to press her
against his heart, and tell her again and again how he
loved her—so passionately that he would have deemed the
world well lost for her sweet sake.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">ADIEU.</p>


<p>“Are you not a long time getting to the Hall?” inquired
Lady Gwendolyn innocently. “It looked so very
near when I was at the top of the tree. I am afraid I
must be dreadfully heavy, after all. Do let me try to
walk.”</p>

<p>“Not for the world; you might injure yourself for
life,” he replied. “I could have hurried a little more, only
that I was afraid of shaking you.”</p>

<p>Of course he could. Lady Gwendolyn knew that as
well as he did, and smiled to herself. Surely he deserved
that she should play with him a little, when for two long
years he had kept her in suspense as to the state of his
feelings, and had only betrayed them by accident now.</p>

<p>“You carry me beautifully,” she said, with her most
gracious air. “You must be wonderfully strong.”</p>

<p>“I used to be; but I have seen my best days, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What age are you?” she asked, in her
usual downright way.</p>

<p>“Nearly thirty-four.”</p>

<p>“Say thirty-three; there is no need to anticipate. I
shall be twenty next week; but I mean to call myself
nineteen until twelve o’clock on Monday night. When I
reach twenty-five I shall pause there for four or five
years, and then go on as slowly as possible, counting
every other year, until I am awfully old, and then I
sha’n’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Would you really mind now if you were—thirty,
say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—I should,” she replied, with great decision.</p>

<p>“Then how dreadfully you must feel for me, Lady
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it signifies about a man’s age, unless he
is beginning to get infirm. But you have plenty of good
years before you yet, Colonel Dacre.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are a true prophet, Lady Gwendolyn. I
can assure you that, so far, I have only seen the dark side
of life.”</p>

<p>“And yet to outsiders you always seem such a very
fortunate person.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Why?”</p>

<p>“You have plenty of money, a fine old property, health
to enjoy your advantages; and, therefore, as the world
argues, you are an exceedingly fortunate person.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I forgot,” he said bitterly; “money is everything
in this world; and yet how little it can buy—of what
one values most, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, it buys diamonds!” exclaimed Lady Gwendolyn
naïvely.</p>

<p>“And you value them more than anything?”</p>

<p>“Well, they are property,” said her ladyship, with a
provoking laugh. “I get tired of an ornament so soon;
it is nice to know I can dispose of it to advantage, and
buy something that pleases me better with the money.”</p>

<p>“Lady Gwendolyn, I give you notice that I don’t believe
a word you are saying.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not believe you to be so bad as you make
yourself out,” he pursued, with indignant emphasis, for
he was trying to convince himself as well as to shame
her. “But I cannot understand the pleasure of shocking
people.”</p>

<p>“Because you are not sensational.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” he ejaculated fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Why ‘Heaven forbid?’ There is nothing so delightful.
I should die of ennui down here, if it weren’t for
an occasional tragedy or surprise.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped you won’t have one too many,” he
answered gravely.</p>

<p>She lifted her mutinous face from his shoulder to look
into his eyes, and then subsided back into her warm shelter,
smiling an odd, keen, satisfied little smile, which
seemed to say: “You belong to me so thoroughly now
that, whatever I may say or do, you cannot break your
bonds.”</p>

<p>And, alas! it was only too true. He knew this himself
by his undiminished longing to crush her into his arms—to
carry her away to some quiet corner of the earth,
where she might belong to him undisputed, and satisfy his
whole being with the sweetness of her presence. For
this he would have resigned gladly all the advantages she
had just been enumerating; for this he would have
sacrificed everything but his honor, and hope of heaven.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, after a long pause, “why don’t you
talk?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say, Lady Gwendolyn, that would
be sufficiently tragical, or surprising, either, to amuse
you,” he answered, with indulgent irony.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that. Do you know what somebody
told me once?”</p>

<p>“Somebody must have told you so many things at different
times.”</p>

<p>“But I mean about you?”</p>

<p>“I am no Œdipus, Lady Gwendolyn,” he answered;
and, though he constrained himself to speak coolly, his
lips went white.</p>

<p>“That you have a secret in your life—a skeleton in
your cupboard,” she said, in a quick breath, that showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
that she was speaking with a purpose, and not out of
mere audacity and carelessness. “Is it true?”</p>

<p>He seemed to swallow down a great lump in his throat
before he could answer her; and then his voice was
strangely hoarse, and unlike his natural tones.</p>

<p>“Do you ask this out of curiosity only, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>It was her turn to steady her voice before she responded:</p>

<p>“No—at least, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me your motive?”</p>

<p>And, unconsciously, in his eagerness he stooped over
her, until his lips touched her hair.</p>

<p>“I—I want to know,” she stammered out.</p>

<p>“That is not a reason.”</p>

<p>“It is the best I can give you.”</p>

<p>“The best you can give me would be the true one.”</p>

<p>“A woman does not like to confess that she is curious,”
she said evasively.</p>

<p>“Then it is curiosity?”</p>

<p>“I did not say so.”</p>

<p>“You implied it, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that speech was given to us to enable
us to conceal our thoughts, Colonel Dacre?”</p>

<p>“You are fencing the question. I wish you would be
frank with me for once.”</p>

<p>“It is a great mistake to be frank. You only put
weapons into your enemies’ hands for them to wound you
with.”</p>

<p>“But you are not obliged to be frank with enemies,
Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“If once people get into the habit, it is very difficult
to break it off. Besides, who is to discriminate between
friend and foe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“I thought a woman’s wonderful instinct always helped
her there.”</p>

<p>“Not always. For instance”—saucily—“I have never
been able to discover yet whether you like me or not.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be extraordinarily obtuse,” he answered,
in the same tone.</p>

<p>“I acknowledged as much just now.”</p>

<p>But at this moment they reached the Hall, in spite of
Colonel Dacre’s lingering, and he carried her carefully
over the threshold, and placed her on the sofa in a small
room, which had once been his mother’s boudoir, and
where the pretty things a refined woman likes to collect
around her lay about in elegant profusion.</p>

<p>“Now I will go and speak to my housekeeper, and place
you in her charge during my absence,” he said; and was
moving toward the door, when she put out her hand
and detained him.</p>

<p>“Colonel Dacre, will you do me a great favor?”</p>

<p>“A dozen if I had the chance,” he answered, with more
vehemence than he was conscious of.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any one to know I am here until you
return.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Lady Gwendolyn, it is impossible that I
should leave you without assistance.”</p>

<p>“Not if I prefer it?” she asked, with her most persuasive
accent.</p>

<p>“When people want things that are bad for them we
generally serve them, in spite of themselves, by a denial.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but this is not really bad for me. My foot has
entirely ceased to pain me, and what I want now is simply
rest and quiet. I know Mrs. Whittaker, and she is
a terrible gossip. I could not stand her in my best
moments; now she would irritate me beyond endurance.”</p>

<p>Seeing him still hesitate, she added, in a decided tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, then, if she comes, or any fuss is made
in the house, I will hop home, somehow, Colonel Dacre.
There will be an astonishing story abroad to-morrow if
Mrs. Whittaker is taken into our confidence——”</p>

<p>“But how is this to be avoided?” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Very easily indeed. Lady Teignmouth will come to
fetch me presently, and how should your servants know
that we did not arrive together?”</p>

<p>“You forget that we shall have to account for Doctor
Thurlow’s sudden visit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any need for that. You are not surely
bound to keep your servants <i>au courant</i> as to all your
movements.”</p>

<p>“That is about the last thing I should think of as a
rule. I trouble myself very little about what they think;
but I am naturally sensitive for you, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case, you must see that my proposition
is a good one. The servants are less likely to talk if
they have nothing to talk about.”</p>

<p>“You don’t do justice to their inventive faculties, Lady
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t profess to understand them much,” she answered,
with the hauteur of a true patrician. “I always
hear that they are very unsatisfactory people; but I am
sufficiently fortunate, I suppose, for I don’t often change
my maids.”</p>

<p>“And I never change mine,” he said, laughing. “I always
find the same faces here when I return from my
travels. But are you quite determined to banish Mrs.
Whittaker, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“Entirely. I infinitely prefer to be alone; and as I am
free from pain, and perfectly composed, I really don’t
see what I could do with her if she were here, except
listen to your praises.”</p>

<p>“And that would be too trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“I never said so; but, as you advocate frankness, I will
admit that I would rather the pleasure were postponed.”</p>

<p>“Sine die, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Dacre, you are too spiteful! I won’t listen
to you any longer.”</p>

<p>And she turned her face to the wall, with a resolute
air.</p>

<p>He went down on one knee, and said in a tragical tone:</p>

<p>“I cannot depart without your forgiveness. There is
a deep pit on the Teignmouth Road, and, blinded by
despair, I should be sure to fall into it! There is also
a swift river beyond. You will not, surely, send me
forth to certain destruction?”</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, and his lips fastened on it
eagerly, passionately. She kept her face averted still,
but she did not chide him, and a faint tremor went
through her whole frame. Then slowly she turned her
head, and, looking him straight in the eyes, said softly:</p>

<p>“You have not told me your secret yet.”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet abruptly, as if he had been
stung.</p>

<p>“Who told you I had a secret?” he asked, in a stifled
voice.</p>

<p>“Some one.”</p>

<p>“Is it impossible that ‘some one’ should lie?”</p>

<p>“Tell me it is so, and I will believe you.”</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me, Colonel Dacre?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear you, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“Then answer something,” she added, in an impatient
tone.</p>

<p>Again he was mute.</p>

<p>She snatched her hand away from him, and turned
her face to the wall once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“I understand you, Colonel Dacre. You have a secret,
and one you would be ashamed to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Is that a necessary inference?” he inquired, in a low,
constrained voice.</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are too prejudiced to be just.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should be. You and I were
always good friends, in the social sense of the term. For
instance, you always asked me for two or three dances
when we met at a ball, and sometimes you even took me
down to supper. I have even known you to shelter me
from the sun by holding my parasol at a garden-party;
and once you so far sacrificed yourself as to play croquet
at my desire. After that I never allowed myself to doubt
your devotion, I assure you; and I am surprised you
should think I could be prejudiced against you.”</p>

<p>“Can you never be serious?” he said painfully.</p>

<p>“I am serious now.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think so.”</p>

<p>“Why? I have not said anything bad, have I?”</p>

<p>“No; but if your seriousness is so much like jest, how
is one ever to know which you mean it to be?”</p>

<p>“You must wait for circumstances to enlighten you.”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon—circumstances.”</p>

<p>“You are very enigmatical, Lady Gwendolyn, and, as
I said before, I am no Œdipus.”</p>

<p>“Then you give me up?” she said, laughing.</p>

<p>“As a riddle, yes. There never was a man yet who
could fathom a woman, from Adam downward.”</p>

<p>“It was never intended that you should, evidently, or
Eve would not have been allowed to set such a precedent.
Weakness is often obliged to seem like duplicity in
self-defense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Do you call yourself weak? Physical strength is
not the greatest, after all, or Una would never have
tamed the lion.”</p>

<p>“If you lapse into allegory, I am undone,” she said
gaily. “I am no ‘scholar,’ as the poor people say. What
little my governesses managed to teach me I have forgotten
long ago.”</p>

<p>“And yet, I heard you translate a Latin epigram very
creditably the other day.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Colonel Dacre. Your ears deceived you.
I should have been so exhausted mentally by the effort
that I should not have been able to frame an intelligible
sentence for at least a year afterward, and you see I am
quite rational to-day.”</p>

<p>He rose with an impatient, weary air. It seemed as if
she were such an incorrigible trifler, and had so thoroughly
accustomed herself to look on the ridiculous side
of everything, that now she could not be serious even if
she wished.</p>

<p>And yet she was so lovely; and what better excuse did
a man ever need for such folly?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the colonel muttered to himself, rather grimly, as he furtively
examined the delicate profile which was just sufficiently
out of the straight Greek line to give it more
piquancy without losing the grace of the model.</p>

<p>Though she was somewhat above the middle height, she
might have worn Cinderella’s glass slipper with ease,
and her hand was so small, and soft, and plump, it
seemed to melt in your grasp.</p>

<p>Altogether, she was the only woman yet who had ever
entirely satisfied him. Others had charmed him for a
time, but he had never learned to love them because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
somehow they had always managed to disenchant him
before he reached that point. But he had only to see
Lady Gwendolyn to tumble headlong, foolishly in love;
and though he had been struggling to get out of bondage
ever since, each month seemed to strengthen his chains.</p>

<p>Now he had surrendered at discretion, and felt himself
at the mercy of this black-browed witch of a woman,
who seemed to think it a pleasant pastime to break the
hearts of those who loved her.</p>

<p>Having almost reached the door, he came back to say
wistfully:</p>

<p>“Do you forgive me for disobeying you, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered shortly and sternly; for she was
given to these Protean changes of mood. “You have
not told me your secret.”</p>

<p>“Why will you harp upon that miserable subject? I
do not question you upon your past.”</p>

<p>“You have no right,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>A sudden glow crept into his face; his eyes shone with
triumph.</p>

<p>“You think that you have a right to know mine, then,
Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>She saw then what inference she had favored, and grew
crimson to the very roots of her hair under his searching,
impassioned gaze. Amazed at her own embarrassment,
she answered petulantly:</p>

<p>“I wish you would let me rest, Colonel Dacre. I might
as well have had Mrs. Whittaker if you were going to
gossip like this.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he answered, with a formal bow;
“I forget that I might be boring you. What message
shall I give Lady Teignmouth from you?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, thank you. Say what you think fit.
She is sure to be shocked, anyhow, for she is the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
unmitigated prude I ever knew; but she will recover
herself in time, I dare say. Will you kindly hand me a
book before you go?”</p>

<p>He chose one that he thought would interest her, placed
it on a little table beside her sofa, with very evident
pleasure in the service, and then, remembering Lot’s wife,
he left the room without once looking back.</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth’s park adjoined his, and he had not
far to go; but, on reaching the house, he heard, to his
dismay, that his lordship and wife had driven out together
to make some calls, and were not expected home
until six o’clock.</p>

<p>Of course he could not confide his errand to the butler,
and, therefore, he simply said that he would call
again later, and took his way toward the village. But,
as luck would have it, Doctor Thurlow was also absent,
having been sent for a few minutes before he arrived;
and, as his patient lived nearly eight miles off, there was
not much chance of his being back for an hour and a half,
at least.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre began to think that everything was
conspiring to drive him crazy. He might reasonably have
counted upon taking back one of the three people he had
gone to fetch, and so setting Lady Gwendolyn right with
the world, supposing her adventure got wind; and not
knowing what to do now, he decided to walk back to the
Hall as quickly as possible, and hear what his guest
wished done.</p>

<p>He began to see now that it was a mistake to have
taken her there at all. If he had only carried her into
Bates’ house, nothing could possibly have been said—only
that people always think of these brilliant expedients
when it is too late to carry them into effect, and as it
had not suggested itself to Lady Gwendolyn she could
hardly blame him for his forgetfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>He had left the door ajar, and stole into the house
unperceived. Perhaps in his heart of hearts he was not
sorry that he should have another tête-à-tête with Lady
Gwendolyn, though he would not have confessed as much
even to himself, so anxious was he to be honorable even
in thought.</p>

<p>The door of the little boudoir where he had left her
was shut fast, and he knocked softly thrice without receiving
any answer. At last, fancying that the girl must
have fallen asleep, he opened it with a certain hesitation
and peered in, naturally glancing first toward the sofa,
where he had seen her last, reclining helplessly back
among the cushions.</p>

<p>She was not there.</p>

<p>Somewhat alarmed now, he walked boldly in, and
searched even behind the curtains, thinking, perhaps,
her ladyship was coquetting with his fears, and enjoying
his discomfiture from her hiding-place. But she
was not there, or anywhere, so far as he could perceive,
and he paused in great perplexity. Had the Teignmouths
chanced to call while he was away, and carried her off?</p>

<p>This seemed the most feasible solution of the mystery,
considering the state she was in, and he was about to
adopt it, when he suddenly caught sight of a little three-cornered
note lying on the table which he had placed beside
Lady Gwendolyn’s couch.</p>

<p>It was addressed to “Colonel Dacre,” and, tearing it
open eagerly, he read the following words, whose expressiveness
was only equaled by their laconicism:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have found out your secret at last. Adieu.”</p>
</div>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A RUSE DE GUERRE.</p>


<p>Colonel Dacre stood quite still for several minutes,
holding Lady Gwendolyn’s letter in his hand, and so
completely stunned by the misfortune that had come
upon him, he could scarcely realize its magnitude as yet.
Had Lady Gwendolyn’s accident been a mere pretense and
blind? And, if so, had she any excuse for her deception?</p>

<p>These were the two questions he put to himself the
moment he could reason. There was only one thing that
could have justified such a course of action on Lady
Gwendolyn’s part; and if she had had this motive, he
was ready to forgive her. He would not judge her, then,
until they had met and he had interrogated her, when,
even if her tongue labored to deceive him still, he should
know the truth by her eyes.</p>

<p>But he could not present himself at the Castle a second
time that day, and he might have betrayed Lady Gwendolyn
by so doing; as there was just the chance that she
had been able to get home without Lord and Lady Teignmouth
knowing anything about her little adventure.</p>

<p>He must wait, therefore, until the morrow for a solution
of the double mystery, trying as the suspense was.</p>

<p>Before the household was astir he got up, plunged into
a cold bath to freshen himself a little, and then went out
into the lanes, which he paced up and down until breakfast-time.</p>

<p>The meal was a farce—he was much too excited to
eat; but he thought it necessary to sit down to table, and
help himself from one of the savory little dishes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the butler forced upon his notice. He did not care to
set them gossiping in the servants’ hall; and Graham had
already remarked, with the freedom of an old retainer,
that “he feared his master must have had a bad night,
since he had risen so much earlier than usual.”</p>

<p>To wait until the afternoon was beyond Colonel Dacre’s
courage; and as he and Lord Teignmouth had been at
Eton together as boys, he thought he might venture to
make a morning call for once in a way. So he ordered
his horse at a quarter to twelve, and got through the
interval as best he could.</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth was at home, and received him cordially
in the library. He was a hearty, pleasant-mannered
man, who managed to enjoy life vastly, although the
countess was not reckoned, in the neighborhood, to be a
very satisfactory wife. But, if frivolous and vain, her
ladyship was sweet-tempered, and accorded as much liberty
to her husband as she took herself; so that they kept
on excellent terms—all the better, perhaps, that they
were so seldom together.</p>

<p>It was purely an accident that they were both at the
Castle now, as her ladyship had an engagement elsewhere;
but a slight feverish attack had brought her down to
Teignmouth for rest and fresh air, and she was as much
charmed as surprised when she found her husband and
sister-in-law ruralizing, also.</p>

<p>“It is so seldom one can manage to be quite en famille,”
she said affably; “the world is such a tyrant, it is
always claiming one. I am horribly tired of gaiety, but
one must do as others do, you know.”</p>

<p>And when the earl laughed, as he always did at his
wife’s logic, she opened her large blue eyes, and added
innocently:</p>

<p>“Well, but mustn’t one, dear?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre asked after the countess’ health with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
great apparent solicitude, as he shook hands with his
host, and was, of course, delighted to hear that she had
entirely recovered from her recent indisposition. Then
he added, with assumed nonchalance:</p>

<p>“I trust Lady Gwendolyn is equally well.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s where the land lies, is it?” thought the
earl. But aloud he said, with a certain twinkle of the
eye:</p>

<p>“I trust she is, too; but I haven’t seen her since last
night.”</p>

<p>“No?” put in the colonel, waiting eagerly for further
information.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” Lord Teignmouth went on, in a confidential
tone, “girls are never of the same mind two
days together. Yesterday morning Gwen was enchanted
with Teignmouth, and declared she would give up all
her engagements and stay here for the autumn; in the
evening, at dinner, she suddenly announced that she was
bored to death, and should leave by the first train in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“And this morning she changed her mind for the third
time, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! I thought she would, of course, and
quite expected to see her at breakfast; but when, on her
not presenting herself, I made inquiries, I found that
she had left Teignmouth by the first train.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre felt himself turn pale, but managed to
say, with tolerable composure:</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that, as she was kind enough to lend
me a book the other day, and I have not had the opportunity
of returning it. But perhaps you will kindly give
me her address, and then I can send it by post.”</p>

<p>“Her address. Let me see,” said the earl, with provoking
deliberation. “I know it is somewhere in the
North.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I am afraid that is rather vague.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is,” he answered, with his frank laugh.
“But I have such a confoundedly bad memory. Pauline
would remember, I dare say. She is generally my
prompter. Supposing you go and ask her yourself?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure I should not be intruding on Lady
Teignmouth?” inquired Colonel Dacre, whose eyes had
suddenly brightened at the proposition.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am certain her ladyship will be delighted
to see you.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth was reclining on a lounge by the
open window as Colonel Dacre entered, and her very attitude
showed how thoroughly bored she was; but at
the sound of his name she turned, with evident relief,
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“How very kind of you to take compassion on a poor
recluse!” she said gaily. “I am literally dying of ennui!
I do hope you have brought me some news.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I have come here for news,” he
answered, seating himself in the chair her ladyship
pointed out.</p>

<p>“Then you have been taken in, I am afraid. Nothing
new ever happens at Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” he said, his voice trembling
a little; “Lady Gwendolyn’s sudden departure is something
new.”</p>

<p>“I am so accustomed to these strange caprices of hers,
they never seem new to me,” replied Lady Teignmouth,
hardening a little. “It is a great misfortune when a mere
girl has such a horror of anything like control. I am
going away to-morrow myself, and she might as well have
waited and traveled with me as far as town, but she
would not listen to my proposition. She preferred to be
quite free, she said; and so she is gone off, goodness
knows where, in spite of everything I could say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Lord Teignmouth told me she had left you her address,”
hazarded the colonel timidly.</p>

<p>The countess gave him a sudden, keen look right in
the eyes, and then shook her head.</p>

<p>“You know poor dear Reginald always does make blunders,
Colonel Dacre. Gwen said something about letting
us know shortly where she was to be found, but I think
it was only a parting civility to which it would not do to
attach much importance.”</p>

<p>“But what motive could she have for concealing her
whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“I never profess to understand Gwen’s motives for
anything, Colonel Dacre; nor do I, as a rule, interfere
in her plans. The best thing that could happen to her
would be to get a husband who would keep her in order,
for what little authority Teignmouth might have
as her guardian he never exercises, so that she is getting
more and more lawless every day.”</p>

<p>“Lady Gwendolyn may consider that she is justified in
pleasing herself so long as Lord Teignmouth does not
remonstrate; he is the only person who has a right to take
this tone with her as yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I never interfere, if that is what you mean,” responded
her ladyship, smiling that sweet, stereotyped
smile of hers which imposed upon so many. “I have no
right, as you say.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre had not said exactly this, but he let it
pass, and observed, after a pause:</p>

<p>“Then you cannot give me any idea where Lady Gwendolyn
is to be found?”</p>

<p>“Not the faintest. But she may write in a day or
two, and then I will let you know, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” he said; and then he added,
with assumed carelessness: “She was quite well, I hope,
when she went away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly,” answered Lady Teignmouth, opening her
eyes very wide, as if she were surprised at the question.</p>

<p>“She did not complain of her foot at all?”</p>

<p>“Why should she?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I thought she might possibly have sprained
her ankle,” he said evasively. “She walked so much more
here than she is accustomed to do.”</p>

<p>“She pleased herself; there was a carriage always at
her disposal. You ought to know, Colonel Dacre, that
my husband is absurdly weak, so far as Gwen is concerned,
and would try to get her a slice of the moon if
she wanted one.”</p>

<p>“It is a very amiable weakness,” said the colonel, smiling.</p>

<p>“But not always a convenient one for his wife.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre began to understand the countess better
now. She was jealous of her beautiful sister-in-law.
She never made the faintest effort to retain her husband’s
affection; still she did not want him to care for anybody
else, and was never so near losing her temper as when
anything reminded her of the good understanding that
existed between the brother and sister.</p>

<p>Then, again, although a pretty woman, the countess was
quite eclipsed by Lady Gwendolyn, which was another
reason why she should not regard her with much favor.
However, she did not care for an outsider to know exactly
the terms they were on, for she added, in an indulgent
tone:</p>

<p>“I dare say it is very natural, after all. There are
only two of them left now, and their mother left Gwen
in Reginald’s charge, so that he looks upon her as a sacred
legacy. Only, of course, she is but young, and it would
be better if he looked after her a little more, would it
not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it would,” he admitted. “But it is just possible
Lady Gwendolyn would not submit to be dictated
to.”</p>

<p>“In that case she ought to marry, and take the responsibility
off our shoulders, Colonel Dacre,” replied the
countess, with more decision than she usually infused into
her company manner. “I am sure you would hardly believe
how worried I was by her numerous flirtations last
season.”</p>

<p>“I should have fancied there was safety in numbers,”
remarked her listener dryly.</p>

<p>“For her, perhaps; but I am afraid it only made it
more dangerous for them. If this were a dueling age,
Gwen would have a good many on her conscience, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“But, you see, men do not always care to risk their
lives for a woman whom they know is trifling with them,”
said Colonel Dacre slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, you speak very philosophically of love, as if it
were a light feeling that helped you through a few idle
hours, but was not likely to take any deeper hold.”</p>

<p>“You quite misunderstand me, I assure you. I think
love a terrible thing, and pity those who fall into it,
with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“While taking warning by their example,” insinuated
Lady Teignmouth, smiling.</p>

<p>A quick flush passed over the colonel’s face. The significance
of her manner made him tremble for his secret,
which he feared was in very unsafe keeping. He hastened
to deny the “soft impeachment” in self-defense.</p>

<p>“Exactly. As a mere looker-on I can judge the question
dispassionately, which would not be the case, supposing
my feelings were implicated.”</p>

<p>This time her ladyship laughed outright. She evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
thought his logic rather defective. Then, becoming
suddenly grave, she said:</p>

<p>“If love is a terrible thing under ordinary circumstances,
what must it be under extraordinary circumstances?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by extraordinary circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you cared for a coquette—we will say?”</p>

<p>“I hope I never should, Lady Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, too, for your own sake. And, unfortunately,
I have seen so many poor moths consumed in a
certain flame that I tremble now for every one that approaches.
The only chance, so far as my experience
goes, is to keep out of the way.”</p>

<p>“On the principle that ‘prevention is better than cure,’”
he answered lightly. “I agree with your ladyship there,
up to a certain point; still, if one were always on the
lookout for painful possibilities, life would not be worth
living, would it?”</p>

<p>The countess yawned demonstratively.</p>

<p>“Is it now, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, with decision. “I find it so.”</p>

<p>“You really surprise me;” and she leaned back on her
couch with an air of extreme languor. “Do you know,
Colonel Dacre, I often wonder what some people are
made of—nothing seems to trouble them.”</p>

<p>“Possibly those are just the people who feel things the
most. Real suffering is generally quiet.”</p>

<p>She turned on him abruptly.</p>

<p>“Is that why you are so quiet now?”</p>

<p>“I cannot think why your ladyship will persist in attributing
to me a secret sorrow or passion,” he retorted.
“Do I look very Byronic?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered readily; “but you see I have
got quite into the way of looking upon every man I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
seen with Gwen as one of her victims, and you have been
very often with her of late.”</p>

<p>“So have half a dozen others. I suppose they were
my companions in misfortune?”</p>

<p>“Don’t jest upon such a serious subject,” she said, with
her malicious smile.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” he observed, rising, “however hard hit I
may be, I shall know it is not of any use appealing to
your ladyship for sympathy—Lady Gwendolyn’s ‘victims’
seem to make excellent sport for you?”</p>

<p>“When they don’t bore me. You know it is too much
to expect one woman to sit and listen to another’s praises
for two or three hours together. That is occasionally my
fate; and I must frankly confess that I dislike it extremely.
If I were to show the least sign of weariness,
I should be looked upon as a monster, for every one ought
to enjoy the capitulation of Gwen’s marvelous perfections.
Do you know I sometimes quite wish I were her
mother; I suppose I should like all this vastly then, especially
if they had the tact to refer now and then to
my past triumphs, and insinuate that my daughter was
just what I must have been at her age. But—you are
surely going to stay to luncheon, Colonel Dacre? My
husband won’t forgive me if I don’t keep you, and I am
sure you would not like to be the cause of our first
conjugal difference, would you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing would distress me more; but Lord Teignmouth
is too just to lay my fault at your door.”</p>

<p>“But, really, Colonel Dacre, you must stay. A man
without home-ties has no excuse for refusing an invitation
of any sort. I look upon bachelors as public property
myself. Come,” she added persuasively, “I will make a
bargain with you. Stop and lunch with us, and I will tell
where I think it probable you may find Lady Gwendolyn—supposing
you really wish to see her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Would your ladyship mind telling me why you so
particularly want me to stay?” said the colonel; led by
the countess’ manner to suspect some trick.</p>

<p>“Certainly; we are quite alone to-day, and I have private
reasons of my own for avoiding a tête-à-tête with
my husband. Are you satisfied with my explanation?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre bowed silently. He was not satisfied,
by any means, but it was rather difficult to say so.</p>

<p>“Then you will stay?” added Lady Teignmouth, after
a minute’s silence.</p>

<p>“With pleasure.”</p>

<p>A smile, so full of malicious triumph, shone in the
countess’ eyes, that if Colonel Dacre had only seen it
before, it would have served as a warning to him. But
having accepted, he could not retract now, although he
was more than ever persuaded that the countess was
playing him a trick.</p>

<p>This idea was confirmed when, just as he was pocketing
the card on which his companion had written the
address he wanted, the Handley drag drove up to the
door, and emptied its living freight into the hall, which
swept on up the wide staircase, laughing and talking.
But Lady Teignmouth was equal to the occasion. She
looked straight at her guest, without so much as a blush
on her cool, pink cheek.</p>

<p>“It is the Handley party come to luncheon—how very
kind of them. No fear of a matrimonial tête-à-tête now.”</p>

<p>“Then I am not wanted any longer, Lady Teignmouth?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, you are wanted more than ever.
You know how difficult Clara Handley is to amuse.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t be facetious to order, Lady Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>“You can pay compliments, and that is all Clara cares
about,” responded the countess, who had by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
a high opinion of her own sex. Then she went forward
to greet the young lady herself with great affection,
kissing her on both cheeks, and congratulating her upon
the effect of her new hat, leaving the colonel quite bewildered
and pained in his heart, for he had always had
a chivalrous respect for women, and it grieved him to
know that even one could be so false.</p>

<p>He had to take Clara Handley into luncheon, and exerted
himself to be agreeable, but his thoughts were elsewhere,
and he was glad when the meal was over. When
the whole party adjourned to the grounds to play lawn-tennis,
he shook hands with Lord Teignmouth, and slipped
quietly away.</p>

<p>He was just congratulating himself upon having paid
Lady Teignmouth a little trick as anticipative vengeance
for the one he suspected her of having planned for him,
when he suddenly found himself face to face with the
countess herself.</p>

<p>“I just ran away for a minute from the others to wish
you good-by, and bon voyage,” she said, her whole face
in a glitter of malicious delight. “I am sure you will
enjoy yourself up there, the country is so picturesque.
Give my love to Gwen, and tell her that directly she is
tired of solitude, I shall be happy to chaperon her anywhere.”</p>

<p>Shaking himself to get rid of the disagreeable impression
her ladyship had left behind, Colonel Dacre rode
rapidly toward home, and scarcely felt safe from Lady
Teignmouth’s shafts until he found himself once more
in the library of Borton Hall.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TUROY GRANGE.</p>


<p>The address Lady Teignmouth had given Colonel
Dacre was Turoy Grange, near Westhampton, Yorkshire;
and after looking out for Westhampton on the map, and
settling the route he ought to take, he rang the bell, and
told the butler to pack his traveling-bag and order the
carriage for the four-o’clock train.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t be gone more than three or four days,”
added the colonel, seeing the other looked surprised.
“You may confidently expect me by Saturday at the
latest.”</p>

<p>It was to be hoped Graham did not take his master
quite at his word, for a great many Saturdays would
come and go before Colonel Dacre would cross his own
threshold again.</p>

<p>Indeed, he little suspected what this journey was to
bring forth, or he would have counter-ordered his dog-cart
assuredly, tossed Lady Teignmouth’s card into the
waste-basket, and made up his mind to await calmly the
issue of events, and abide by the result.</p>

<p>However, four o’clock saw the “gallant colonel”—as
the local newspaper always designated him—stepping into
a first-class carriage at Borton Station, bound for “fair
London town,” en route for Turoy Grange, near Westhampton,
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>He remembered as he went along that he had often
heard Lady Gwendolyn speak, half jestingly, of her
“mansion” at Turoy, and declare it to be such a “ghostly
place that only a person with a very clear conscience
could venture to stay there even for a night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>She and Lord Teignmouth had often spent their holidays
there when children; but then their mother was
alive, and the place had been made bright for their occupation.</p>

<p>The last four years it had been seldom inhabited, although
it was one of Lady Gwendolyn’s caprices to have
it kept in perfect order and repair, that it might be available,
supposing she cared to run down there at any
time.</p>

<p>An old nurse of hers, with her husband, lived in the
house—that Colonel Dacre also remembered to have
heard; and had been pleased at Lady Gwendolyn’s
thoughtful provision for one who had been good to her
when she was a child. But from the description given
him of Turoy it was the last place for a spoiled beauty
to take refuge in, unless she had some reason at the moment
to feel disgusted with the world and her friends,
and needed a spell of solitude to get her into a better
mood.</p>

<p>“If I could believe that she had run away to Turoy on
my account I should be the happiest man alive,” Colonel
Dacre said to himself, with a wild thrill, for it seemed to
him that this would be sure proof that he was not indifferent
to her. “Otherwise, what could there be in my
secret to pain and annoy her?”</p>

<p>And then he set himself to work out the problem how
she could have found anything in his mother’s boudoir
to enlighten her on this point. He had not solved it
to his satisfaction when the train whistled its way into
London, and he was obliged to attend to the more practical
details of his journey. He found, on consulting the
time-table, that there was no train which stopped at
Westhampton until the morning express, and, therefore,
he decided to go to a hotel, and get a few hours’ rest.</p>

<p>He was not naturally vain, but it did strike him that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
should gain in the end by this delay, as a battered-looking,
travel-stained, wobegone man would not make his appearance
on the Turoy scene with much effect. And he
could not afford to dispense with a single advantage in
the contest before him, for he knew the adversary he had
to deal with, and that if once he gave Lady Gwendolyn
the chance of making a jest at his expense he was undone.</p>

<p>She was one of those women who would forgive a
lover for having committed a crime, but would never
pardon him if he made himself ridiculous. So that Colonel
Dacre gave himself seven good hours’ sleep, and
started the next morning in excellent health and spirits.</p>

<p>The journey was a long one, but with hope for a
companion time passes so quickly, and whenever he was
beginning to grow weary he refreshed himself by picturing
Lady Gwendolyn’s blush and smile, her well-feigned
surprise, her delicious embarrassment, her mutinous
grace, as she welcomed him to her “mansion.”</p>

<p>The train only stopped at a few of the largest stations;
but at Preston there was a halt of ten minutes, and he
went to get himself a biscuit and a glass of sherry. As
he returned to the platform to regain his carriage, he ran
up against a lady whose figure struck him as familiar.</p>

<p>Nothing could be simpler than this lady’s dress, and
yet it was worn with an elegance that suggested strange
possibilities to his mind, and made him follow the owner
curiously. She seemed startled and annoyed by his
scrutiny, although the thick Shetland veil she was wearing
not only concealed, but distorted her features so much
that it was impossible to recognize her, supposing even
she had been the person he had come northward to seek.</p>

<p>But his suspicions had never taken that direction for
a moment. This lady was taller than Lady Gwendolyn
by at least a couple of inches, and there was a sort of insolence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
in her bearing which Colonel Dacre seemed to
know only too well.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, he thought of Lady Teignmouth,
and, wondering what mischief was hidden under this disguise,
kept close to her heels. She quickened her pace,
and presently, to his surprise, jumped into a third-class
carriage.</p>

<p>A common man in the corner moved forward to make
room for her, and evidently recognized her superiority,
for he said, almost respectfully:</p>

<p>“Won’t you come here, miss? you’ll find it more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, zir, I am sure,” answered the other, with
an abominable accent. “Although, for the matter of that,
bad’s the best.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre waited to hear no more. He was quite
satisfied now that the young person in the Shetland veil
was some lady’s-maid, who had learned to copy her mistress
successfully enough to deceive an outsider, until
she opened her mouth. Then there could be no doubt
about her social status whatever; and it quite amused
him to picture Lady Teignmouth’s horror, supposing she
had been told that he had taken a third-class passenger,
with a northern burr, for her aristocratic self.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey passed without further incident.</p>

<p>On getting down at Westhampton, Colonel Dacre
found himself looking out rather curiously for the heroine
of his little adventure at Preston; but she was not there,
nor in the third-class carriage where he had seen her
last, so that either she had changed her seat, or had got
down at one of the intermediate stations.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it doesn’t matter to me,” he said to himself.
“I have had abundant proof that it is not Lady Teignmouth,
and that was all I wanted to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>There was one rickety fly waiting outside the station,
and Colonel Dacre engaged it at once, and told the man
to drive direct to Turoy Grange. It was only four miles
off, but the roads were so bad, the country so hilly, and
the poor horse so groggy, that it was an hour and a half
before they came in sight of Turoy, a little cluster of cottages,
with a small, gray church tower rising out of their
midst.</p>

<p>Another steep ascent brought them into the village;
they stopped in front of a low, old-fashioned house.</p>

<p>“This is the Grange, zurr,” said the coachman; and
Colonel Dacre jumped out gladly.</p>

<p>Then he rang the bell, and as he heard it echo through
the silent house, a sudden nervous fear seized him lest
he should have done ill in coming.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was so peculiar that the thing which
would have helped him with another woman might ruin
him with her. Nobody answered his first summons, nor
his second; but when he rang a third time he heard a
step along the hall, and the door opened at last—slowly
and reluctantly.</p>

<p>A respectable-looking middle-aged woman presented
herself, and evidently regarded Colonel Dacre with great
disfavor.</p>

<p>“What may you be pleased to want?” she asked, with
cold civility.</p>

<p>“I want to see Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t at home,” replied the woman, and she was
about to shut the door again in his face.</p>

<p>But he was prepared for this movement, and had inserted
his knee in the aperture, that he might have time
for parley.</p>

<p>“I suppose she is staying at Turoy? Lady Teignmouth
gave me this address.”</p>

<p>But even the countess’ name and authority could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
soften the woman, who seemed to take her post as door-keeper
much too strictly, unless she had received stringent
orders.</p>

<p>“Whether she is or she isn’t staying at Turoy, she isn’t
in this house now,” was the reply, spoken with great determination.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has gone out for a walk?” the colonel
observed, trying an indirect question.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has.”</p>

<p>“In that case, I think I had better call again later, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Just as you like; it’s no affair of mine.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre’s temper was naturally good, but it
began to fail him a little now.</p>

<p>“I should have fancied you were left in the house on
purpose to give information,” he said. “Anyhow, you
might as well give a civil answer to a civil question. I
am sure Lady Gwendolyn would not consider that you
served her interests by being rude to her visitors.”</p>

<p>“Her ladyship knows too well about me for anything
people might say to trouble her,” answered the woman
quietly. “I do my duty, so far as I know how; and I
can’t help the rest. If her ladyship came down here it
is because she wants rest and quiet; but, of course, if she
told me to let in a whole regiment I should obey her.”</p>

<p>“Then she has told you not to admit any one?”</p>

<p>“I never said so, sir.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, I shall return in a couple of hours,” responded
Colonel Dacre, irritated almost beyond endurance,
and he turned on his heel and marched briskly
away.</p>

<p>He looked back when he reached the gate, and caught
just one glimpse of a graceful dark head at one of the
windows; but it was withdrawn before he had time to
identify it. And he went on his way, wondering if Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Gwendolyn was as false as her sister-in-law, or if she
was one of those women who love to torture those in
their power.</p>

<p>He adjourned to the village inn, and ordered a bottle
of wine, simply for the sake of getting into conversation
with the landlord, who seemed much gratified when
he was told to bring a second glass and help himself.
The sherry was potent, and loosened mine host’s tongue.</p>

<p>What sort of a neighborhood was it? Why, as poor
as poor could be. He never got any genteel custom from
week’s end to week’s end, and that was very trying to a
man who had lived in good families before he took up
with the public line, and liked to keep in his own set.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t supply the Grange, then?” said
Colonel Dacre, looking as innocent as a dove.</p>

<p>“Bless you, sir, there’s no supplying as far as the
Grange goes. The lady it belongs to doesn’t come to
Turoy more than once a year, and then she is a teetotaller.”</p>

<p>“That is very unfortunate,” returned Colonel Dacre
sympathetically. “I suppose she isn’t here now?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t tell you, sir. Her coming or going doesn’t
make much difference to me, although some people are
delighted enough.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is good to the poor?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe she is that,” he admitted. “But I am
afraid you don’t like the wine, sir. You see, having so
little trade in that way, I can’t afford to keep much of a
stock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; you are quite right,” answered the colonel.
“Have you a decent bed for me, supposing I decide to
remain at Turoy to-night?”</p>

<p>“The best in the world, sir; I’ll answer for that,” responded
mine host. “And I shall be proud of your
patronage and recommendation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Dacre strolled out into the village to pass away
the time, and it was growing dusk when he presented
himself once more at Lady Gwendolyn’s door. This time
it was answered by a stalwart, weather-beaten man of
about fifty, who, in reply to his question, said, civilly, that
her ladyship was not at home.</p>

<p>“Could I see her if I called in the morning?” pursued
the colonel.</p>

<p>“I doubt if she’ll be at home then; but, of course, you
must do as you like about the calling.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, I want to see Lady Gwendolyn upon particular
business,” added Colonel Dacre impressively. “I
am sure she would not refuse to receive me if she knew
this, and I should be really obliged if you would mention
it to her. Or would it be better if I wrote a line, and
explained matters myself?”</p>

<p>“I should almost think it would, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but is she sure to get my letter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy anybody would steal it, sir,” replied the
man shortly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that, of course; but if she is not here
it could be forwarded, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“There would be no difficulty about that.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre tried to slip a sovereign into his hand,
but the man was evidently obtuse, for he let it drop, and
seemed quite surprised when he heard it ring on the
stone floor.</p>

<p>“You are losing your money, sir,” he said; and,
having picked it up, he handed it back with such a virtuously
reproachful air that Colonel Dacre dared not so
much as hint that it was for him, and restored it to his
pocket in rather a crestfallen way.</p>

<p>He went back to the inn to secure his bed, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
he returned to the charge. Seating himself on a bank
just outside the gate of the Grange, he watched the house
and garden both.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed without incident. The evening
began to darken perceptibly, and he saw a light in one of
the lower windows, and the outline of the female dragon’s
head, but she was evidently a discreet woman, for she
quickly drew down the blind, and raised it no more.</p>

<p>But though it must have been quite dark indoors by this
time, there was no other sign of the house being inhabited.</p>

<p>He was beginning to think that he had come on a wild-goose
chase, and that Lady Gwendolyn might be at the
other end of England, after all, when suddenly his heart
began to tremble and his pulses to quicken. He had
caught sight of a white figure standing in the porch, and
fancied he knew that this was Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>She stepped daintily out from under a trellis-work of
roses and clematis, and looked from side to side, as if she
were in search of some one.</p>

<p>“Does she regret her cruelty just now?” he asked himself,
his breath coming short and fast from an intense
eagerness of expectancy, while the wild longing within
him almost frightened him, as a sign of the terrible empire
this passion was gaining.</p>

<p>It might be so, for she glided forward to the gate
like a spirit; and, standing there, looked down the road
with something wistful in her attitude, as it seemed to
him. He had almost decided to step forward and accost
her, when she drew back suddenly, as if something had
frightened her, and turned down a little path with shrubs
on either side.</p>

<p>He had not seen her face distinctly, for she had a
white shawl over her head, and was holding it close under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
her chin to protect her from the night air; but he could
have no doubt that this was Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>He got up and followed.</p>

<p>He saw her walking slowly, and looking about her with
the expectant air he had noticed at first; then suddenly
she paused, a dark figure stepped out of the shadow of
the trees, and Colonel Dacre, with a jealous thrill, saw
Lady Gwendolyn’s creamy fingers pressed fervently
against the newcomer’s black mustache.</p>

<p>How he restrained himself from rushing forward and
confronting the pair he never knew. At this moment
he felt like a murderer, and thirsted for the blood of this
rival, whom Lady Gwendolyn preferred to himself.</p>

<p>She had carried her coquetry cruelly far, for she had
won his whole heart, and had left him only just sense
enough to suffer and regret.</p>

<p>So false and yet so fair. Oh! why had he not been
warned in time? He could have given her up easily in
the first days. Now, although he knew all her perfidy,
and believed her to have neither conscience nor feeling,
he could not drag his love up by the roots, although it
must needs be his sorrow and shame. When she passed
her arm through the man’s, with a few soft words he
could not catch, and they moved away together, Colonel
Dacre did not follow.</p>

<p>He was too honorable to seek to surprise their confidence,
and, moreover, he was afraid of himself. If he
met this man face to face he should kill him like a dog,
for the old Cain was rampant in him at the moment, and
he felt that his only chance was flight.</p>

<p>With a few bounds he reached the open space in front
of the house, dashed through the gate, and hurried back
to the Sun. He ordered something to be cooked for
his supper, in order that he might not be disturbed just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
yet and then he shut himself in his own room—out of
temptation’s way—thank Heaven for that! for it made
him tremble to think how near he had been that night to
committing a terrible crime.</p>

<p>When the fowl was ready, it was necessary to go down,
and make a pretense of eating—of course. The landlord
waited on him himself, and as he removed the cover,
with a flourish, he said:</p>

<p>“You were asking if her ladyship was at the Grange,
sir, this afternoon——”</p>

<p>“Well?” exclaimed Colonel Dacre, turning sharply
round in his eagerness.</p>

<p>“I have ascertained that she arrived to-day.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre could not answer for a minute, he felt
as if he were choking. He began to carve the fowl to
gain time; and, having divided every joint, and distributed
the pieces over the dish for mine host to hand
round to some imaginary guest, he managed to say at
last, with well-feigned indifference:</p>

<p>“Indeed; I suppose she came alone?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir—she always does.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause; and then he added cheerfully:</p>

<p>“This has been a stirring day, sir; it isn’t often we
have two bedrooms occupied, and two suppers to cook.
I wish it would occur oftener, I am sure. Sherry, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answered the colonel feverishly; and he
pushed forward his tumbler instead of his wine-glass;
emptying it at a draft, as if it contained water, as soon
as it was filled.</p>

<p>He was a very abstemious man generally, but he did
not know what he was drinking to-night. His one
thought was to slake his consuming thirst with whatever
came easiest to hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“I am afraid you have a poor appetite, sir,” observed
mine host, after watching him toy with a merrythought,
like a delicate girl, and he filled up the tumbler again.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre lifted it to his lips once more, and set
it down half empty this time. He had fasted all day,
and felt strangely excited by what he had taken, although
it would have had no effect under different circumstances.
Ordering the table to be cleared, he lighted
a cigar, and began to smoke it slowly, his somber glance
fixed on the open window, while he listened for every
sound.</p>

<p>Presently the church clock struck twelve solemnly out
in the darkness, making him start in his chair, and recalling
him to the fact that his cigar had gone out. He
tossed it through the window, and lighted another. He
was in that nervous, overwrought state when his whole
body seemed full of pulses, and his temples kept up a
measured, oppressive beat.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre fancied he knew who mine host’s other
guest would be; but he had sworn to himself only to listen
for his step. Though he was calm now, and could trust
himself, it would be a terrible risk to see the face of
Lady Gwendolyn’s lover, lest they should meet again
one day when he was not master of himself.</p>

<p>Presently a step came along the road—a firm, brisk
step, which had a cheerful sound—the step of a happy
lover, who had brought away tender memories with
him, and still feels the sweetness of a timid parting kiss
lingering on his lips.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre sat back firmly in his chair, and covered
his eyes. But when the door opened he glanced up mechanically,
and there stood the man he had sworn not to
look upon for his soul’s sake.</p>

<p>The other drew back at once, with a hurried apology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
for his mistake, and a courteous bow; but Colonel Dacre
knew that wherever they might meet he should recognize
him again, and that the cool, proud face, with its
insolent beauty, would be from henceforth imprinted on
his brain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">WOMAN’S WAYS.</p>


<p>Of course it is very comfortable to be a philosopher.
When people have once succeeded in persuading themselves
that it is as easy to reason as to feel, it is wonderful
how smoothly life ends.</p>

<p>As Colonel Dacre sat in the little inn parlor that night,
he tried hard to attain that enviable state of mind, and
to be able to say, with a shrug of the shoulder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If she be not fair for me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">What care I how fair she be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it would not do. He did care, and so much, that
he could have dashed his head against the wall for very
rage and misery.</p>

<p>But there was one thing he could not understand, and
that was why Lady Teignmouth took so much interest in
seeing him disenchanted. She must have sent him to
Turoy, knowing quite well whom he would meet there,
and enjoying the thought of his pain. It was strange to
find a young and handsome woman so cruel—and he
had never harmed her—that she should take pleasure in
dealing him such a blow. But for some reason she was
his enemy; and as he began to divine how utterly unscrupulous
she was, the idea was not an agreeable one, by
any means.</p>

<p>He passed the livelong night pondering, trying to come
to some resolution; but unable to form any plan, so entirely
stunned was he to find that the woman he had loved
so chivalrously was unworthy of his long devotion.</p>

<p>Of course it would have been more dignified to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Turoy early in the morning, and this had been his first
intention; but as the night wore on a softer feeling intervened,
and he decided that he must see Gwendolyn
once more.</p>

<p>For two years now she had been the star of his life—his
one only thought. To win her at last he had been
ready to possess his soul in patience, and the longing was
still strong on him to look on her again, ere he went sorrowfully
into exile for her sake.</p>

<p>As dawn began to break, he went softly up-stairs, and
lay down for awhile without undressing. When he heard
people about below he was glad to rise again, and go out
for a walk. Nothing was harder than to be inactive
when his thoughts stung him like very swords.</p>

<p>On returning to the inn, two hours later, he heard, to
his relief, that mine host’s other guest had already breakfasted,
and was gone, taking his carpetbag with him.</p>

<p>“And quite the gentleman I am sure he was,” observed
the landlord, smiling benignantly; “for he paid his bill
without even looking at the items.”</p>

<p>“A hint for me,” thought the colonel, as he sat down
to breakfast, with his face toward the Grange, a glimpse
of which could be seen through the open window.</p>

<p>But it was not until nearly eleven o’clock that he saw
the gate open, and Lady Gwendolyn came forth, her perfect
figure showing to advantage in a closely fitting dark
serge dress, while a jaunty little hat, garnished by a
red feather, shaded, without concealing, her beautiful
face. He fancied her manner was listless, and preoccupied,
and she kept her eyes on the ground as she advanced.
Nothing, however, showed her conscious of his
scrutiny, and she did not so much as even glance toward
his window as she went by.</p>

<p>Now, if the colonel had been a philosopher, here was
a chance of airing his theories. But we have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
said that he was nothing of the sort, and so he caught
up his hat, and hurried after Lady Gwendolyn as fast as
he could.</p>

<p>He came up with her just as she was crossing a stile
leading into some meadows. She turned abruptly, and,
startled by such a sudden apparition, would have fallen
to the ground had he not put out his arm to save her.</p>

<p>For one brief, delicious, maddening moment she was
leaning against his breast—so close that a stray lock of
her dark hair blew across his lips, while the bewildering
perfume he knew so well was fast stealing his senses,
and weakening all his fine resolutions.</p>

<p>But directly she recovered her footing she disengaged
herself, and changed rapidly from white to red, and then
from red to white again, while she thanked him, in a constrained
manner, for his assistance.</p>

<p>“I am not accustomed to these high stiles,” she said.
And then she added coldly: “What brought you here,
Colonel Dacre?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t the country worth seeing, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“Quite; only people never do come here to see the
country.”</p>

<p>“There is ‘metal more attractive,’ perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.” And she looked into his eyes unflinchingly,
while her color wavered again. “Although I have retired
from the world I have taken no vows, and am, therefore,
still at liberty to welcome my friends.”</p>

<p>“Then I am forced to conclude that you do not look
upon me as a friend, since you refused to see me last
night?”</p>

<p>“I was not able to do so,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“I know; you were better employed.”</p>

<p>“Was I? You seem to be wonderfully well informed
as to my movements, Colonel Dacre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Too well, Lady Gwendolyn. But allow me to congratulate
you upon having so quickly recovered from your
sprain. You seemed to be suffering so much that afternoon
I left you on the couch in my mother’s boudoir I almost
feared you would not be able to walk for some time.”</p>

<p>The mere shadow of a smile hovered on Lady Gwendolyn’s
red mouth; but she suppressed it directly, and
said:</p>

<p>“A woman can generally manage to do anything she
wants to do.”</p>

<p>“And you walked back to the Castle?”</p>

<p>“Really, Colonel Dacre, you are exceedingly curious!”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I am. Nobody likes to be deceived.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t pleasant, certainly,” she answered, with a bitter
smile. “But women are quite accustomed to that sort
of thing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Accustomed to deceive, you mean, of course.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn turned from him disdainfully.</p>

<p>“You, at any rate, ought to be indulgent to a failing of
this kind, Colonel Dacre, since you have lived a lie, so
to speak, for a great many years.”</p>

<p>He uttered a sharp exclamation of surprise at such an
extraordinary accusation.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he inquired at last. “You are
surely dreaming, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were!” and there was a ring of passionate
regret in her voice. “If all the world had disappointed
me, I would still have sworn that you were true, until—until
the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“And then I knew the truth.”</p>

<p>“What truth? Upon my word and honor, I have not
the least idea what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Come, Colonel Dacre, is it worth while to deny anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to me? I do not accuse you, remember; I have no
right; I simply state a fact. It is a pity you sought the
meeting I would have avoided, for it must needs humiliate
you as it pains me.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in my past that humiliates me in the
smallest degree. I have had great sorrows, but they
were not brought about by any fault of my own. I came
here to seek you because I considered that you owed me
an explanation, and I did not choose you should be able
to say that I could not defend myself against your implied
accusation. But what I saw last night has altered
my feeling in the matter, and if I sought you this morning
it was only because I am a miserable, weak stupid,
and wanted to see your face once more before we parted,
never to meet again, I trust, on this side of the grave.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn had turned very pale, but her pride
sustained her still, for the stately head never lowered
itself one inch, and her full under lip curled in a disdainful
smile.</p>

<p>“You must have seen some strange things last night
to change your intentions and feelings so suddenly, Colonel
Dacre.”</p>

<p>He was silent. Her calm effrontery was so startling
that it seemed almost as easy at the moment to doubt
his own eyes as to doubt her. But then she was only a
fine actress, of course. She was so greedy of power that
she could not bear to lose a single worshiper, and would
have kept him at any cost if he showed that he was
weak enough to give her his heart to toy with and
break.</p>

<p>“The things that I saw last night were not strange,”
he said hoarsely. “I dare say they would have seemed
natural enough to any other looker-on, but, as I told you
before, I am a miserable stupid; I believed in all women,
and you above the rest; and now——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“And now?” she echoed softly as he paused.</p>

<p>“And now I believe in none; and in you, least of all.”</p>

<p>“You are more candid than complimentary, Colonel
Dacre.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—I cannot flatter.”</p>

<p>“It would be almost better if you tried to acquire the
accomplishment,” she returned haughtily. “People who
pride themselves upon being frank are exceedingly bad
company.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, I sha’n’t be in your way long, Lady
Gwendolyn. I leave Turoy in a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>“For Borton Hall?”</p>

<p>And if he had been a coxcomb he would have detected
the ring of suppressed eagerness in her voice.</p>

<p>“For a couple of days only. I am going abroad, and
shall not probably return for three or four years—if
then; so that I have a few arrangements to make with
my steward. I shall let the Hall, if I can get a good
tenant.”</p>

<p>“You cannot do better,” she said, with sudden, almost
stern decision. “You have no right to live there, as
it were, under false pretenses.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t understand you, Lady Gwendolyn, and
must beg you will explain.”</p>

<p>“I did not understand you just now, Colonel Dacre;
but I did not demand an explanation.”</p>

<p>“You had a perfect right to do so.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but it is not my habit. If people take a
pleasure in misjudging me——”</p>

<p>“A pleasure?” he interrupted vehemently. “Oh! if
you only knew what it cost me last night to believe what
I saw.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you believe it?”</p>

<p>“I could not help myself.”</p>

<p>“I make it a point of never believing anything I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
wish to believe,” she said slowly and determinedly. “After
all, it is so easy to make mistakes——”</p>

<p>“Under some circumstances. But if you actually see
a person——”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you cannot make a mistake. But
people sometimes fancy they see things, you know. To
be absolutely certain myself I should require to look into
another’s face—so close that I could not be wrong, otherwise
I would not allow myself to condemn even my greatest
enemy. I have a great many faults, I know, but I
always strive to be just.”</p>

<p>“And yet, you condemned me unheard, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“When?” she asked.</p>

<p>For sole answer he took from his pocketbook the
little note she had left on the table of his mother’s
room the day of her pretended accident, and held it up
before her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said half defiantly.</p>

<p>“Was that either just or true?”</p>

<p>“It was true, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You cannot prove it, Lady Gwendolyn. I should be
an idiot, indeed, if, having a secret to guard——”</p>

<p>“Which you admitted,” put in Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>“Or, rather say, which I did not deny. But I repeat
that I should have been an idiot indeed if, under these
circumstances, I had introduced you into the very room
where you would find something to betray me.”</p>

<p>“There was nothing in that room to betray you.”</p>

<p>“Where, then?”</p>

<p>“I am not bound to say.”</p>

<p>“I think you are, for your own sake. I am sure you
would not like me to think that you had taken any
mean advantage of the small courtesy it was such a great
pleasure to me to show you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“How can it signify to me what you think?” she flashed
round upon him to say.</p>

<p>His silence was a rebuke, and shamed her as no words
could have done. She colored hotly up to the very
roots of her hair.</p>

<p>“I mean,” she added, “that you would be sure to misunderstand
me.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I will tell you nothing. I have a right to my
secrets as well as you.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like,” he said, bowing coldly. “It is better
so, perhaps. But I am keeping you from your walk,
Lady Gwendolyn. Let me thank you before I go for the
many pleasant hours you have allowed me to pass in
your company. The memory of them will always be both
a pleasure and a pang.”</p>

<p>He could almost have vowed that he saw two large
tears in her dark eyes; nevertheless, she said, carelessly
enough to outward appearance:</p>

<p>“It is not very probable that I shall ever cause you
another pang, so that you can afford to pardon me. I
have quite made up my mind not to return to Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>“I suppose one may expect to hear of your marriage
shortly?” he observed, conscious of another pang at this
moment—a pang so strong that it whitened his very
lips, and made his heart tremble within him.</p>

<p>“My marriage? No, thank you. You are much more
likely to hear of my taking the veil.”</p>

<p>“You are the last person I know to do such a thing as
that, Lady Gwendolyn. You are too fond of the world
to desert it.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” she answered, with a gravity that surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
him. “I suppose the kind of intercourse you and
I have had makes it impossible that you should understand
me.”</p>

<p>“And you think that I was flirting with you, Lady
Gwendolyn?” he said, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>“Assuredly; and why not?”</p>

<p>“I should not have dreamed of insulting you thus.
The whole aim and ambition of my life was to win you for
my wife—that I swear.”</p>

<p>“And yet you say you would not have dreamed of insulting
me.”</p>

<p>“By professing what I did not feel, I meant!”</p>

<p>“Or promising what you could not perform?”</p>

<p>“I never did such a thing in my life, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“According to your own account you were on the brink
of it a little while ago. What right have you to ask any
woman to be your wife? And, supposing she accepted
you, what, then?” inquired Lady Gwendolyn, with angry
vehemence.</p>

<p>“Why, then, we should marry, I presume.”</p>

<p>“How could you?”</p>

<p>“I see no just cause or impediment, Lady Gwendolyn!”</p>

<p>“Then I am sorry for you, that is all. I can understand
people’s doing wrong from the evil impulse of the
moment; but it must be a very bad man indeed who
would commit a deliberate fraud, and ruin the woman
who trusted in him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why my marriage would have
such terrible consequences, Lady Gwendolyn. One would
think that I was a monster in human form.”</p>

<p>And then, in spite of himself, he smiled to think how
completely Lady Gwendolyn had turned the tables upon
him. He had joined her, intending simply to bid her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
adieu, in order that he might look once more on the
fatal beauty that had stolen his heart away, and if any
conversation did take place he certainly pictured himself
as the accuser, whereas he had done little else but defend
himself, and had only been able to get in his own complaints
edgewise.</p>

<p>Decidedly Lady Gwendolyn understood the art, and
also the advantage, of carrying the war into the enemy’s
country. And yet, though he had seen her in the arms
of another man, and knew her to be an unprincipled coquette,
how he yearned after her, his mad infatuation
increasing as he gazed, until he felt as if he could not
give her up were she twenty times worse than she was.</p>

<p>He drew near to her with a look in his eyes no woman
can misunderstand even when she sees it for the first
time. His lips were trembling with the eager, passionate
words that flowed up from his heart; his face was as
white as death.</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn,” he said hoarsely, “you must despise me
as much as I despise myself, but I cannot let you go.”</p>

<p>The hour of her supreme triumph had come—the hour
she had panted for, and longed for even in her dreams.
This man, who had resisted her so long, was at her feet
now, in spite of himself, and for one moment her victory
seemed very sweet.</p>

<p>Then a revulsion of feeling came over her, and she
hated him as intensely as she had loved him before. If
he despised himself for falling into her power, if he was
only in love with her beauty and would still win her for
that when he deemed her unworthy of any finer sentiment,
her victory was no better really than a defeat.</p>

<p>She drew away from him quickly, and burst into a passion
of tears.</p>

<p>“You are right,” she sobbed out; “I do despise you;
but I despise myself still more. How horribly I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
have lowered myself to inspire such a feeling as you
have dared confess. At least, you might have spared
me the knowledge, Colonel Dacre, if only because I am
of the same sex as your mother.”</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn, you don’t understand me. I am asking
you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“Which is the greatest insult of all,” she responded.
“Oh! go away—pray, pray go away. I would rather be
alone.”</p>

<p>“Give me my answer first, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“You have had your answer.”</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to reply, when suddenly Lady
Gwendolyn’s face assumed an expression of stolid composure,
and she added, in a loud, formal voice:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will find this a very dull place, Colonel
Dacre. Beyond a little fishing, there is really nothing for
a gentleman to do. Oh! is that really you, Captain Wyndham?”
holding out her hand cordially, to a tall, pale man,
who had approached them without attracting her companion’s
attention. “Allow me to introduce you to Colonel
Dacre—a near neighbor of my brother’s, at Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>The two men bowed to each other coldly. It is odd
how quickly lovers scent a rival, and no very friendly
look passed between them; although, outwardly, each assumed
to be gratified at making the other’s acquaintance.
But Colonel Dacre was too agitated to be able to keep
up this farce long, and, pleading business, left the two
together. But instead of going on to the station, according
to his original intention, he returned to the inn,
and took possession once more of the little parlor he had
occupied the day before.</p>

<p>He cursed his own folly bitterly; but even if this
woman destroyed him, he could not tear himself away
from her now. The very air she breathed was sweet to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
him, and yet, poor deluded mortal, he had fancied it possible
to escape from her toils.</p>

<p>That day passed like a dream. In comparison with
the agitated ones that followed it seemed so vague and
colorless to Colonel Dacre, that it slipped from his memory
later as if it had never been.</p>

<p>He saw no sign of Lady Gwendolyn again, and the
Grange windows did not betray her presence. At dusk
he ventured out for a stroll, and mechanically—guided
by fate, no doubt—he crossed the stile that led into Turoy
Wood—a pretty shaded walk in the sunny part of the day,
but almost dark now.</p>

<p>He walked on steadily for about half an hour, finding
it a relief from the worry of his thoughts to be moving,
and minding little where he went.</p>

<p>But presently he came back to himself with a start.
He distinctly heard, a few paces in front of him, the
voice of the man who had roused all the Cain in him,
and made him afraid of himself. And he knew, by the
sudden wild riot in his pulses, and the mad jealousy in
his heart, that he was no better to be trusted than before,
and so, to his infinite regret later, he hurried from
the spot, and made his way back to the inn as fast as
he could.</p>

<p>He did not even feel safe until he had bolted the
parlor door, although Mr. Wiginton distinctly said he
did not expect another customer that night, and shut
up the house at eleven o’clock, as usual.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre went to his room then, even undressed,
and lay down, although he knew sleeping was out of the
question. He heard all the hours strike up to three
o’clock, and then he fell into what seemed like a doze,
although all his senses were unnaturally acute. So acute,
indeed, that when he heard a groan presently, he knew
what direction it had proceeded from, and did not wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
for a repetition to spring out of bed, and hurry into his
clothes.</p>

<p>In another minute he was down the stairs, and, unbolting
the door softly, so as not to disturb mine host, he
found himself in the garden.</p>

<p>Another groan, fainter though than the first, guided
him to a little copse by the roadside, where lay, apparently
in the agonies of death, Lady Gwendolyn’s “braw wooer,”
the man whose splendid privileges he had envied the
night before.</p>

<p>For one cruel moment Colonel Dacre rejoiced to see
his enemy laid so low; but better feelings intervened, and
he remembered nothing but that the other was in a sore
strait, and needed his aid.</p>

<p>He knelt down beside him, and said quite gently:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are hurt. Have you had an accident?”</p>

<p>The dim eyes unclosed, and the blue lips muttered a
word faintly. But although Colonel Dacre bent close
down he could not catch it, and he shook his head expressively.</p>

<p>The dying man made a great effort, and repeated, in
a loud whisper:</p>

<p>“Poisoned.”</p>

<p>“By whom?” inquired Colonel Dacre, resolutely but
reluctantly.</p>

<p>But the poor creature’s mind had wandered off, and
he babbled of “Mother” incoherently, as if he fancied he
were a child again.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre would have fetched some brandy from
the inn, but as he saw that no human means could avail
aught, he considered it better to remain where he was.</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily he began to repeat the beautiful
prayer with which most of us begin and end our day, and
when he came to “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
them that trespass against us,” the dying man raised
himself on his elbow, and said, loudly and distinctly:</p>

<p>“Tell her I forgive her, and——”</p>

<p>But the sentence was never finished in this world. He
fell back heavily on the turf, and when Colonel Dacre
looked into his face he saw that he was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE LAST WALTZ.</p>


<p>For fully five minutes Colonel Dacre knelt beside the
lifeless body, then he rose up stern and resolute to do
his duty. First of all he roused Wiginton, and had the
dead man carried into the inn, and laid on the bed he had
occupied twenty-four hours ago. Wiginton evidently
thought that it was a case of sudden death, for he said,
with real feeling:</p>

<p>“Poor gentleman! And he looked so healthy, too.
Hadn’t I better go for a doctor, sir?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had; although it will be of no use,” was
Colonel Dacre’s reply.</p>

<p>“I dare say not; but it might have an ugly look if we
tried to hush the thing up, sir.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre saw the reasonableness of this argument,
although it had not occurred to him in the agitated preoccupation
of the moment. He promised to watch beside
the dead man while Mr. Wiginton went to the village to
fetch the doctor. But it so happened that Doctor Dale
had been up all night with a patient, and was just passing
the house on his way home as Wiginton issued forth.</p>

<p>His visit was a mere matter of form, naturally. As
there were no signs of violence on the body Doctor Dale
drew the same conclusion as Wiginton, that the man died
by the visitation of God. He put a few questions to
Colonel Dacre, as to whether he knew the deceased gentleman,
or had any reason to suppose that he had been
the victim of foul play. And on the other replying in the
negative he seemed perfectly satisfied, and said he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
go home and get a little rest, and send round to the coroner
later in the morning.</p>

<p>“He has probably died from heart-disease,” he concluded,
moving toward the door. “But that we shall
ascertain, I have no doubt.”</p>

<p>“You will have a post-mortem examination, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; at least, I have no doubt of it whatever.”</p>

<p>“You are not prepared, then, to give a certificate as to
the cause of death?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly. I like to be very careful in these
matters, as one’s reputation is often at stake. This gentleman’s
family will investigate the case thoroughly we
may be sure, and I think it is better to be beforehand with
them. You say you have no idea who the poor fellow
is?”</p>

<p>“Not the faintest. But he may have letters in his
pocket that would enlighten us.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” replied Doctor Dale, coming back from the
door. “It would be as well to look.”</p>

<p>But save an ordinary-looking cigar-case there was
nothing whatever in the dead man’s pockets. It almost
seemed, indeed, as if this were a precaution, and not an
accident, for the mark on his pocket handkerchief had
been cut out, and the initials on the cigar-case defaced.</p>

<p>Doctor Dale was not a suspicious man, evidently, for
this did not appear to strike him as strange. He simply
remarked as he moved away again:</p>

<p>“The police will, no doubt, be able to trace him. It
would be as well if you were to communicate with them
at once, Wiginton, I think. I must get home to bed or I
shall be good for nothing all day,” he added half apologetically,
“and I am nearly worn out. I owe it to my
patients as well as to myself to take rest when I can, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
no doctor can trust to his head when it is confused for
want of sleep.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you are quite right,” answered Colonel
Dacre, with a secret thrill of satisfaction, for he wanted,
above all things, to gain time. “It is often necessary to
consider oneself for the sake of others.”</p>

<p>“I shall see you later, of course?” said Doctor Dale, as
he departed for his well-earned repose, and Colonel Dacre
nodded.</p>

<p>He had no wish to shirk any inquiry, so far as he was
personally concerned, but he meant to shelter the guilty,
wretched woman whom he loved still, in spite of himself,
and then forget her—if he could!</p>

<p>If he could! Ah! that was a painful proviso; for,
somehow, he could only think of her even now—standing
over her victim—as he had known her in the early days
of her innocent girlhood, when he had believed her to
be as true as steel, and as worthy of his worship as any
saint.</p>

<p>And this was her work. How thankful he was to
escape from its contemplation, and lock the door on the
white face, which was fast settling into the solemn calm of
death, no words can tell.</p>

<p>He followed Wiginton down-stairs, and when mine
host, who looked thoroughly overcome, suggested that a
glass of brandy would not come amiss, Colonel Dacre
welcomed the suggestion, and felt much fortified for the
task before him, when he had taken a good dose of the
stimulant. Then he went to the Grange. He determined
that he would see Lady Gwendolyn at once—even if
he had to steal into her house like a thief—for her only
chance was to escape before the post-mortem examination
made the cause of death evident, and set the police
on the track of the murderer.</p>

<p>The dead man’s presence at Turoy once traced to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
influence, and their secret meetings known, there would
be no hope of her getting away; and though she deserved
her fate, as he was fain to confess, he meant to save
her, even if he perished in her place. But as he was leaving
the inn, Wiginton said rather dubiously:</p>

<p>“It’s no use my going to the village after the police,
for Lady Lenox sent for the inspector over to her
place last night, I heard them say. At her last ball some
thieves got into the house, and stole a good deal of plate,
so that she determined to have somebody to watch the
house this time. I suppose I had better go there, sir,
hadn’t I?”</p>

<p>“If you are sure to find him.”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about that. I saw him outside the
fly that took her ladyship to the ball. It came from the
George, and I suppose the driver gave him a lift so far on
his way.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur went to
the ball, Mr. Wiginton?”</p>

<p>“I believe so, sir. The two families were always intimate,
and it isn’t likely they would leave her out.”</p>

<p>“But she would surely have returned by this time.”</p>

<p>“I think not. Lady Lenox is noted for keeping up her
balls until six or seven o’clock in the morning, and those
who can stand such hours have breakfast before they go
home. She is a very excitable person, and always turns
night into day.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“It is not ten minutes past four,” he said. “How long
would it take us to go to Lady Lenox’s house?”</p>

<p>“About half an hour, sir. But I needn’t take you—surely?”</p>

<p>“I should prefer to accompany you, as I want to see
somebody whom I am likely to find there. But we had
better be quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“I am ready, sir,” answered Wiginton; and they started
at a brisk pace for Bridgton Hall.</p>

<p>About half-way there they met the inspector with his
two men on their way home, looking none the worse
for their night’s watch, thanks to their numerous visits
to the butler’s pantry. Colonel Dacre heard from them
that the ball was virtually over, but that a few favorite
guests still remained, although they could not exactly
say who these last were.</p>

<p>“However, Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur is one,” added
the inspector, volunteering the information Colonel Dacre
dared not ask; “for the driver from the George was asleep
in the harness-room when I left; and I don’t expect he
would have stayed there unless he had been obliged.”</p>

<p>It did not seem probable, certainly, and so Colonel
Dacre left Wiginton to return with the inspector, and
went on alone.</p>

<p>Of course Lady Gwendolyn had gone to the ball, and,
of course, she would be the gayest of them all, outwardly,
for had she not a secret to hide? He could not help
pitying her somehow. She had put her hand to a terrible
thing, but maybe she had had a scoundrel to deal with,
and had been sorely tempted, poor, unhappy child!</p>

<p>His heart was beginning to soften strangely when he
came within sight and sound of Bridgton Hall, but it
hardened again as he paused to listen to a waltz he knew
only too well. Surely that must be Lady Gwendolyn’s
touch—her spirited playing. For the band had been dismissed,
evidently, and they were keeping up the ball to
the music of the piano, which came surging through the
open windows and out into the dewy shrubberies as if
it would have the young man listen and remember. And
he did remember, to his torture.</p>

<p>The waltz finished as he drew near to the door, and
two women came forward to the window, and stood there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
inhaling the freshness of the morning. Both were dressed
in white: one looked flushed and excited under her
wreath of water-lilies; the other, languid but lovely,
turned her calm deep eyes his way, and, recognizing him,
grew suddenly scarlet to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p>He stepped forward at once and lifted his hat, saying,
in a cold, constrained voice:</p>

<p>“Might I speak with you a moment, Lady Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>The color faded out of her face, but she looked up at
him steadily and unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have no time now, Colonel Dacre. I
have ordered my fly, and expect it round every minute.”</p>

<p>“I will not detain your ladyship long,” he said; and
his voice was like ice. “It is absolutely necessary that
you should hear what I have to say, otherwise I would
not disturb you at such a time and in such a place.”</p>

<p>She lifted her head with a haughty gesture.</p>

<p>“It is impossible you should have anything of so much
importance to communicate to me, Colonel Dacre.”</p>

<p>“I think you will find that you are mistaken, Lady
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>His stern, decided manner evidently startled her, for
she turned to Lady Teignmouth, who was standing at her
side, and said quietly:</p>

<p>“Has anything happened, Pauline? Reggie was quite
well yesterday——”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth laughed a nervous, tuneless laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd, Gwen! We should have been sure
to hear if anything had been the matter.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I am very foolish to frighten myself so
easily; but I am tired and nervous, I suppose. I wish
Lady Lenox wouldn’t make me stay so long. I have
tried to slip away half a dozen times at least, and she
has caught me and carried me back. It is a great mistake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to my mind, to bring town habits and town hours
into the country, where we are nothing if we are not
rural.”</p>

<p>She yawned demonstratively as she spoke, and appeared
to have forgotten Colonel Dacre’s very existence,
until he reminded her of it by saying formally:</p>

<p>“Perhaps your ladyship will allow me to accompany
you as far as Turoy? I am sorry to annoy you by persisting,
but I must speak with you privately—for your
own sake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you horrible man!” exclaimed Lady Teignmouth,
with playful impertinence. “You are always full of mysteries!
When I last saw you at Teignmouth you had
something very important and very secret to say to Gwen,
you know.”</p>

<p>He colored resentfully, remembering how she had sent
him to Turoy to meet the greatest sorrow of his life.
Of course she could not know how tragically and painfully
he was to be cured of his infatuation; but she certainly
guessed that he would meet a successful rival at
the Grange, and had taken a malicious pleasure in his
discomfiture. He answered coldly:</p>

<p>“I don’t know why your ladyship should infer that
what I had to say to Lady Gwendolyn the other day was
at all secret or mysterious. I certainly gave you no
grounds for such a belief.”</p>

<p>“You forget that women do not always need to be told
things, Colonel Dacre.”</p>

<p>“They have no right to make sure of anything they
have not been told,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“What a miserable, matter-of-fact place the world
would be if it were forbidden to exercise one’s imagination
a little!”</p>

<p>“It would be safer, anyhow,” he replied; and as Lady
Gwendolyn’s fly drove up at this moment, he opened the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
door and handed her in, a little surprised that she made
no further objection to his plan.</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth parted from them with a jest, followed
by a laugh that sounded forced and unnatural at the
moment, but struck him as strangely incongruous when,
on looking back, he saw her standing still where they had
left her, with such a haggard, troubled face, and intense
eyes, that he shuddered, and wondered if a woman with
that countenance could have an ordinary destiny.</p>

<p>“Well,” she observed at last, “I thought you wished to
speak to me.”</p>

<p>He came back to himself with a start.</p>

<p>“So I did. It is necessary for your personal safety that
you should know the truth at once. The gentleman whom
you met in the wood last evening died two hours ago.
He told me, with almost his last breath, that he had been
poisoned, and sent you a message of forgiveness. All
this will never transpire, of course, however wrong it
may be of me to conceal the truth; but, unfortunately,
there is likely to be a post-mortem examination, and in
that case everything may come out. Are you prepared to
face it?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Are you mad?” she exclaimed,
with a look of apprehension that was really splendid acting.
“You cannot wonder that I doubt your sanity, since
a few hours ago you were pretending to love me, and
now you actually dare to accuse me of a horrible crime.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Lady Gwendolyn,” he said hoarsely; “my
love was no pretense, and you know it; my accusation is
no falsehood, and you know that, too. I witnessed your
first meeting with the wretched man who is dead. I
know that you were together again last night, for I was
in the wood at about nine o’clock, and I heard him address
you in terms of reproach. Of course I witnessed
nothing that passed after this, for I hurried away as fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
as I could; but at three o’clock the poor creature, who had
evidently tried to crawl to the inn for aid, died at the
roadside, with his head on my arm; his last words being:
‘Tell her I forgive her, and——’ Perhaps you can fill
up the hiatus. I pretend to understand nothing that I did
not see and hear.”</p>

<p>She listened to him in stupefied silence, and when he
had finished, she said, in a low, shrinking voice:</p>

<p>“Describe the man to me.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre had not forgotten his appearance, and
drew his portrait accurately enough.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn’s head sank lower and lower on her
breast.</p>

<p>“And he told you he had been poisoned?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; and a man does not lie at such a time.”</p>

<p>“He might have been mistaken,” she said, under her
breath.</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“You would rather believe the worst, I see.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I would give my right arm to be
able to trust you, Lady Gwendolyn,” he cried vehemently.
“If I live to be a hundred years old I shall never have
such a sorrow as this—to be forced to judge the woman
I loved better than my life.”</p>

<p>He expected a disdainful smile, but none came. She
only passed her hand over her brow, as if she were confused.
Then, suddenly, her lips took a resolute fold, and
she lifted her head boldly.</p>

<p>“He did not mention my name?” she said.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you know nothing?”</p>

<p>“People do not commit such dark deeds before witnesses;
but I fancy such evidence as I could give, if I
chose, would hang any one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>She shuddered convulsively—it was the first sign of
actual fear she had shown.</p>

<p>“You surely can have no motive for interfering in the
matter,” she said, after a long pause; and watching his
face anxiously as she spoke.</p>

<p>“When I have warned you my part in the tragedy is
played out, Lady Gwendolyn, so far as you are concerned.
I shall have to appear at the inquest, of course;
but I shall simply state there that I heard the poor man
groan, and found him lying on the bank in a dying
state.”</p>

<p>“And if they ask you if he spoke?”</p>

<p>“Then I shall tell a lie for the first time in my life,”
he answered sternly. “I would not do it to save myself,
but you——”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, in a quiet, firm tone; “that was
all I wanted to know. Perhaps one of these days you
will understand things better than you do now, Colonel
Dacre; meanwhile, I do not think you will reproach yourself
much for what you have done this day—for—for”—hesitatingly—“things
are not always as they seem. I
don’t ask you to shake hands with me, although this is
probably the last time we shall ever meet—and we were
once friends—but I shall always remember you with gratitude.”</p>

<p>“And you will leave England at once?” he said, as the
carriage stopped.</p>

<p>“Never mind about me; I can take care of myself,” she
answered, and, jumping lightly down, she disappeared
into the house.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a slight figure in black came
stealthily out of the Grange; but instead of passing
through the great gate, slipped round by the shrubberies
and out into the road by a gap in the hedge. But Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Dacre, who was watching from his window, saw it plainly
in spite of these precautions, and murmured fervently
within himself:</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, she has thought better of it, and is
gone!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A NOBLE SACRIFICE.</p>


<p>Through the lanes, swiftly, but ever so wearily, sped
Lady Gwendolyn. Her eyes were dim with unshed tears—she
had no time for womanly weakness—her lips were
compressed, until they looked like a mere thread; her
head drooped on to her bosom. She had never known
what shame meant before, and she felt as if she should
never be able to look her fellow creatures in the face
again.</p>

<p>It took her half an hour only to reach Bridgton Hall—this
morning. The stable clock was striking seven as
she entered the grounds, and made her way hurriedly to
the front door. Everything was very quiet, or seemed
so to her, recalling the gay music and laughter that had
filled the house a few hours back.</p>

<p>The butler was yawning in the hall, but did not appear
at all surprised to see her. He was getting too
much accustomed to the caprices and vagaries of fine
ladies to be surprised at anything now.</p>

<p>“Lady Lenox was at breakfast,” he said, “and Miss
Wyndham and three gentlemen were there; but he fancied
Lady Teignmouth had gone to her room. However, he
would inquire directly, if Lady Gwendolyn would step
into the drawing-room for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I need not trouble you,” her ladyship
replied. “I know Lady Teignmouth’s room, and will go
and see for myself.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell Lady Lenox you are here, my lady?”</p>

<p>“It is not worth while, as I shall only stay a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>And, hearing the breakfast-room door open, Lady
Gwendolyn fled precipitately. The thing she could have
least borne at this moment was an encounter with Lady
Lenox, or any of her fast friends.</p>

<p>Knocking at her sister-in-law’s door, she was told to
enter. Lady Teignmouth was reclining on a couch, her
face as white as her embroidered peignoir, and she looked
startled and surprised at this sudden apparition.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you had gone back to the Grange!”
she said.</p>

<p>“I did go back,” returned the other coldly; “but I simply
changed my dress, and returned on foot, as I wished
to speak to you.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth knitted her brows, and did not seem
overpleased.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what you can have to say to me of so
much consequence as that, Gwen. But you do take
very ridiculous notions into your head at times. However,
now you are here you may as well have a cup of
coffee. I sent Clémentine to get me something, and”—with
evident relief—“here she comes. Now make us
comfortable, Clémentine; I am dreadfully hungry. I hope
you have brought enough for two.”</p>

<p>“There is half a chicken, and some ham, my lady.”</p>

<p>“And I shall take nothing but a cup of coffee,” put in
Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Gwen; it’s the greatest mistake in the
world not to eat. When people lose their appetites they
invariably lose their looks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take my chance of that,” replied Lady Gwendolyn
coldly. “Do you want Clémentine?” she added, in a
lower voice. “It is really necessary that I should speak
to you at once.”</p>

<p>“What, have you got mysteries as well as Colonel
Dacre?” she exclaimed, with a levity that would have displeased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Lady Gwendolyn at any time, and absolutely disgusted
her now. “I am very unfortunate in my friends.”</p>

<p>“I think you are,” replied Lady Gwendolyn, with involuntary
sternness.</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth looked straight at her sister-in-law,
flushed slightly, and then assumed a sulky air.</p>

<p>“At any rate, Reggie doesn’t complain,” she said at
last. “And if he is satisfied no one else has a right to
interfere.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn sipped her coffee, and was silent,
waiting for Clémentine to go. But her sister-in-law evidently
made work to detain her; not, perhaps, relishing
the prospect of a tête-à-tête.</p>

<p>However, at last she could not find any further excuse
for her presence, and dismissed her. Nothing loath,
Lady Gwendolyn opened her mouth to speak, then, but
Pauline stopped her nervously.</p>

<p>“I know you are going to say something disagreeable,
that will spoil my appetite; and after being up all night, I
really require support. Please, therefore, let me finish
my breakfast before you begin.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t; every moment is precious.”</p>

<p>“I warn you fairly, I don’t believe you. However, I
suppose you must have your own way,” returned Lady
Teignmouth. And reaching out her hand for a silver
flask that lay on the dressing-table, she poured half its
contents into her coffee-cup, and drank it off like one
well accustomed to potent drafts.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn watched her with rising horror and
dismay. The other laughed defiantly, pretending to be
vastly amused at the effect she saw she had created.</p>

<p>“I thought I should shock you,” she said; “but, really,
I have such miserable nerves, I could not get on without
stimulants. Now, you may talk as much as you like;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
only you will try and be a little more interesting, won’t
you? You have no idea how prosy you have grown of
late.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will think me worse than prosy before
I have done, Pauline; but I cannot compromise with
my conscience. You must know the exact truth——”</p>

<p>“I hate truths,” interrupted Lady Teignmouth petulantly.</p>

<p>“I dare say; nevertheless, you must listen to me. You
are my brother’s wife, and for his sake I will spare you
if I can. But you must leave Bridgton directly; do you
hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear,” replied Pauline obstinately; “but I have
no intention of obeying.”</p>

<p>“Not if your safety depends upon it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean. I am quite safe
here.”</p>

<p>“Yon know better, Pauline.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not. I was never good at guessing riddles.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me! You must and shall go at once. I
am no hypocrite, and, therefore, I do not pretend to
care much what becomes of you personally; but I love
my brother with all my heart, and would not have a
shadow of dishonor to fall on his name.”</p>

<p>“He knew perfectly well that I was coming to Bridgton,”
answered Lady Teignmouth, in a sulky, aggrieved
tone.</p>

<p>“Possibly; but he did not know whom you had come
to meet.”</p>

<p>“One can’t help people following. I don’t suppose you
invited Colonel Dacre to Turoy; but he is there.”</p>

<p>“That is quite a different thing. I am not a married
woman, neither have I given Colonel Dacre secret meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
in the wood. I did not come here to accuse, but to
warn you, Pauline. You must leave the neighborhood at
once, for Mr. Belmont is dead.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth uttered a faint cry, and put out her
hand for the flask mechanically; but Lady Gwendolyn
took possession of it, adding resolutely:</p>

<p>“You shall not stupefy yourself, for you will want all
your wits. An inquest will be held on the body at about
two o’clock, and you know best what may come out. I
shall be silent, for my poor brother’s sake; but others
who have not the same motive for shielding you that I
have, may have seen something, and be quite willing to
give all the information they can. You are safe, so far
as Colonel Dacre is concerned; for, though he knows all,
you have managed things so cleverly that he thinks I
am the wrong-doer.”</p>

<p>Something very like a smile moved Lady Teignmouth’s
pale lips. Even at this supreme moment she could enjoy
the triumph of having hoodwinked and deceived a man
of the world like Colonel Dacre.</p>

<p>If she had injured her sister-in-law at the same time,
and destroyed all her hopes in life, what did it matter so
long as she herself escaped? It was a principle with
Pauline never to trouble herself about other people’s
affairs, and to shift her own burden off her own shoulders
to somebody else’s whenever she could.</p>

<p>“If that is the case, I see no reason why I should disturb
myself in any way. The affair is sure to blow over
comfortably if we keep quiet; and, of course, you won’t
say anything, for Reggie’s sake.”</p>

<p>The tranquil egotism of this speech roused Lady Gwendolyn
at last, and she turned upon her angrily.</p>

<p>“You are right—it is Reggie, and Reggie only, I consider
in this matter. You have spoiled his life, poor fellow!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
but you shall not drag his honor through the mire if
I can help it.”</p>

<p>“You rave like a tragedy queen,” observed Lady Teignmouth
insolently. “Dragging your husband’s honor
through the mire is only done now on the stage.”</p>

<p>“I find, to my sorrow, that it is still possible in real
life,” replied Lady Gwendolyn, with a strong effort at
self-control.</p>

<p>“Because you are romantic, my dear. When once
you get married you will look at things in a more matter-of-fact
light. Reggie and I are tied to each other,
but neither of us has a mind to make our chains too
heavy. He goes his way, and I go mine. I do not call
him to account for anything he may have done during
our separation, and claim a like indulgence from him.
I should not in the least object to his having a little
flirtation, if it amused him; and I don’t really believe that
he wishes to deprive me of a similar distraction.”</p>

<p>“And you call that a flirtation?” exclaimed Lady Gwendolyn
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. The moment I found Mr. Belmont was
taking me too much <i>au sérieux</i>, I told him I would have
nothing more to say to him. Even if he had not died
so suddenly, I should never have spoken to him again.”</p>

<p>“I see; he was becoming a nuisance, and you decided
to get rid of him by fair means or foul.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean? Of course, if I declined
his further acquaintance, he had no alternative but to
accept his dismissal.”</p>

<p>“It is no use talking to me in this way. I know all,”
answered Lady Gwendolyn gloomily. “Mr. Belmont
confessed the truth with almost his last breath.”</p>

<p>“What truth? I wish you would not be so enigmatical,
Gwen. When I can’t understand people directly
they always bore me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, since you will have it, he said he had
been poisoned.”</p>

<p>“Poisoned!” echoed Lady Teignmouth, in a tone of
incredulity that was unmistakably genuine. “I don’t believe
it! He was with me for nearly an hour, and though
he threatened all sorts of foolish things—as men do
under those circumstances—I am sure he never dreamed
of carrying them out.”</p>

<p>“Pauline!” cried her sister-in-law, “will you swear that
you had no hand in Mr. Belmont’s death?”</p>

<p>“I? Why, really, Gwen, you must be mad!” And
Lady Teignmouth looked at her anxiously. “How could
I possibly have had anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>“He was in your way,” said Lady Gwendolyn, so much
impressed by the other’s manner, that she actually began
to believe in her innocence.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I never allow any one to be in my way.
If he and I had both lived to be a hundred years old, I
should not have spoken to him again.”</p>

<p>“But he might have spoken to you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he would, for, with all his faults, he
was a gentleman. You may depend upon it,” she added
argumentatively, “that he died of heart-disease. Those
strong-looking men often have some secret malady that
carries them off suddenly.”</p>

<p>“But I told you that he said he had been poisoned—and
a dying man does not lie.”</p>

<p>“Really, I hardly know how to believe it.” And Lady
Teignmouth looked her companion steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence, and then she added
quietly:</p>

<p>“Do you think that Colonel Dacre killed him?”</p>

<p>“What motive could he have for even wishing him
dead?” inquired Lady Gwendolyn, flushing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“According to your own showing he took him for a
rival.”</p>

<p>“I never said that.”</p>

<p>“Well, he fancied it was you who had met him in the
wood; and that would naturally anger him, since he
loves you himself.”</p>

<p>“Has he told you so, pray?”</p>

<p>“Not in so many words; but I have been aware of the
fact for over a year now.”</p>

<p>“And, therefore, you gave him my address at Turoy?”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth colored.</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked evasively. “Colonel Dacre
would be an excellent match. He is heir presumptive to
a baronetcy; and has now a fine place and ten thousand
a year. You might go farther and fare worse.”</p>

<p>“Still, there might have been drawbacks of which you
knew nothing. Even if I had been engaged to Mr. Belmont,
Colonel Dacre would have had no right to resent
it.”</p>

<p>“You had refused him, then?” inquired the other curiously.</p>

<p>“Certainly not; he had never asked me.”</p>

<p>“Then it was your own fault.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was silent. Lady Teignmouth was
the last person in the world of whom she would have
made a confidante.</p>

<p>Pauline peered into her face for a minute as if she
would read her thoughts. But finding no enlightenment
in the impassible face before her, she added:</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you will never persuade me that you might
not have married Colonel Dacre had you chosen. Upon
one point I claim to be infallible—I always know when a
man is in love.”</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed? You must have studied the subject
very carefully,” replied her sister-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how one is to help it, if one is tolerably
good-looking. Men are so troublesome, you know.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I never knew one yet who would
not take a ‘No.’”</p>

<p>“Really!” And the countess smiled deceitfully. “I
suppose I wasn’t sufficiently firm; for no man ever took
my ‘No.’ I refused Reggie four times.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Gwendolyn indignantly. “My
brother was not the kind of man to repeat an offer, if it
had been once refused. However,” she added, cooling
down suddenly, “I did not come to discuss such questions
with you. Mr. Belmont has not died a natural
death, I am afraid; and at the inquest everything must
come out. Forewarned is forearmed, and you can do as
you think proper now.”</p>

<p>“And I think proper to stay quietly where I am,” returned
Pauline coolly. “No one can do me any harm, excepting
you; and though I am quite aware that you
would not spare me for my own sake, I hardly think you
will try to break your brother’s heart. With all my
faults, he is foolish enough to care for me a little still;
but he cares for his honor still more; and if the least
shadow were cast upon that, the consequences would be
terrible.”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose nobody witnessed your meetings
with Mr. Belmont?”</p>

<p>“I naturally took care about that.”</p>

<p>“In fact, you made use of the Grange, and of my
servants, in order to cover your faults, counting upon the
very mistake that Colonel Dacre made.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Why not? Nothing of this sort could
harm you, as you were not a married woman; and, so far
as your servants were concerned, I merely told them
that you would arrive home so tired you would not care
to see any one; and they immediately inferred from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that your visitor was in some way objectionable. I told
Hannah to say ‘Not at home,’ which would have simplified
the matter, and saved a good deal of breath; but she
assured me neither she nor her husband would tell a lie,
and they should know what to say quite well if I left
them alone.”</p>

<p>“But I was not in the house, surely, when Colonel
Dacre called?”</p>

<p>“The first time——”</p>

<p>“Then he came twice?” interrupted her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Or even three times; he was so very determined to
see you, and so fully persuaded that you were deceiving
him.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn lowered her head thoughtfully. All
these complications harassed her. She began to wonder
if Colonel Dacre had carried his determined spirit so far
as to rid himself of a supposed rival. And yet his horror
and indignation when he accused her had seemed so
natural she hardly knew how to distrust him. Anyhow,
better it should be him than Pauline—since Pauline’s
destinies were bound up in those of her brother—and she
loved Reggie so dearly.</p>

<p>She looked up presently and said:</p>

<p>“I am sorry I did not see him, it might have been
better for us all. But it is no use talking of ‘might have
beens!’—my chief concern is the present. I wish you
would leave Bridgton, Pauline. You know perfectly
well that if you are identified as the lady Mr. Belmont
met in the wood, Reggie will never forgive you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would give me credit for a little common
sense, Gwendolyn. I don’t mean to be identified as any
lady in particular. Not a soul knew that I was at Turoy
excepting Hannah and her husband, and I have bought
their silence. Moreover, they are fully convinced that I
left Turoy exactly two hours before I really did. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
see, you may always trust me to guard poor Teignmouth’s
honor. I was obliged to see Mr. Belmont; but I took
care to manage the affair in a way that would compromise
me as little as possible.”</p>

<p>“I think you might have told me what use you were
going to make of my house, Pauline.”</p>

<p>“That would have been very wise, wouldn’t it? since
you would have taken good care that our meeting did not
come off.”</p>

<p>“All the better.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to tell you, Gwen, that with all your cleverness,
there are some things you do not at all understand.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right, and I have reason to be
thankful that it is so,” retorted Lady Gwendolyn, as she
finished her coffee and rose to her feet. “Anyhow, you
know the truth now, Pauline; and let me tell you this
much before I go: I will hide your faults and follies this
once, at any sacrifice, for my brother’s sake; but the next
time such a thing happens you must take your chance.
It is enough that I have lost the respect of a man whose
good opinion is worth having, for you. I will not aid
you further. If you have not profited by the terrible lesson
you have received, the sooner you and Reggie separate
the better for him; and I shall do nothing to hinder
it.”</p>

<p>“You cross, disagreeable child!” exclaimed her ladyship
cheerfully. “You don’t suppose I shall get into
another scrape in a hurry, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You have such terrible vanity, Pauline——”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know a woman yet who had not? I
really like Reggie immensely, but he has entirely got
out of the way of paying compliments, and making himself
agreeable; and, really, it is quite necessary to go into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the world to hear that one is pretty. Before I have been
shut up three days with my husband at Teignmouth I
feel like an unmitigated fright.”</p>

<p>“Would you have him always flattering you?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly, because I should want a little
sleep. Still, it is the sort of thing one cannot easily have
too much of.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn looked at her with ill-concealed contempt;
and, feeling that she might lose her temper and say
more than she ought to say if she remained any longer,
she wished her a curt good morning, and left the room.</p>

<p>She went down-stairs as softly as she could, being
anxious, above all things, to escape the attention of Lady
Lenox and her guests; but, as luck would have it, just
as she reached the bottom of the stairs, the door of the
breakfast-room suddenly opened, and she found herself
face to face with the gay Irish widow, Mrs. O’Hara.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PAULINE’S TRIUMPH.</p>


<p>Mrs. O’Hara was about the last person Lady Gwendolyn
would have cared to meet; moreover, she knew her
to be a frivolous, pleasure-seeking woman, whose influence
would be very bad for Lady Teignmouth.</p>

<p>Hitherto Pauline had professed to dislike the Irish
widow, but finding themselves together in a country
house, they were sure to do one of two things, either
quarrel desperately, or strike up a violent friendship. And
Gwendolyn, who had her brother’s honor and happiness
so much at heart, knew that this latter would be fatal,
indeed.</p>

<p>She stepped back and bowed coldly, but Mrs. O’Hara
was not to be repressed. She held out her hand with
great cordiality.</p>

<p>“I am so delighted to meet you again, dear Lady Gwendolyn.
I hear you were quite the belle of last night’s
ball. I meant to be here myself, but I provokingly
missed the train at Carlisle, and had to wait there six
hours, so that I am just a day after the fair. I find
that Lady Teignmouth is staying here,” she added, without
giving herself time to take breath, “and I am so
delighted! George Belmont always praises her so much,
I am quite anxious to improve our acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn shivered convulsively.</p>

<p>“Mr. Belmont is a friend of yours, then?” she asked
faintly.</p>

<p>“He is only my brother, but we are excellent friends,
which is rather rare among near relatives. He has just
come into a nice little property in Ireland, and I hope he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
will take a wife and settle down. I don’t mind telling
you, he has knocked about the world a good deal in his
time, and the money was very acceptable; and, what do
you think?” she went on impulsively; “directly he heard
of his uncle’s death, he promised to settle a little matter
that he knew was bothering me a good deal.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn had not much sympathy, as a rule,
with people who confided in the first comer; still, she
could not help feeling for Mrs. O’Hara at this moment,
and sympathizing with the tears of grateful feeling in her
big black eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Belmont might not be a very estimable man, but
he had been kind to his sister, evidently; and she must
needs grieve for him indeed when she learned the manner
of his death, which would be worse to bear than the
death itself.</p>

<p>She had half a mind to give her a hint that would
prepare her for what was coming, and was trying to
pick out words that would be a warning and not a revelation,
when Mrs. O’Hara caught sight of a masculine
figure at the end of the hall, and darted off precipitately.
Her bold laugh followed Lady Gwendolyn into
the garden and sharpened her mood. Somehow, she
thought now that Mrs. O’Hara would get over her
trouble very easily, and only hoped it would take her
away from Bridgton Hall before she had had time to do
any mischief.</p>

<p>She felt so weary and sick at heart she could have
sat down in the hedge and let all the winds of heaven
beat upon her, if she could only feel sure that they would
beat this miserable life out of her, and give her rest.</p>

<p>“For the world is such a cruel, unsatisfactory place,”
she said to herself, in the impatience of a first grief.
“To live is to suffer, and, therefore, it were better to
die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>No doubt if she had felt the chill hand grasping her,
she would have urged a very different prayer; but
Gwendolyn had never known sorrow before, and the
pressure of the wound irritated her. She would have
given up all the promise of the future to be rid of her
present pain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Teignmouth rang for her maid.</p>

<p>“Do you know where the post-office at Bridgton is?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Clémentine could not say that she did.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it will be easy enough to find out,” continued
her mistress. “Put on your bonnet as quickly as
possible, Clémentine, and take this telegram there. You
can write English well now, but must be careful that your
letters are clear and distinct.”</p>

<p>“And am I to wait for an answer,” inquired the French
woman naïvely.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. But read the message over to me, that
I may be sure you understand it.”</p>

<p>Clémentine began in a singsong voice:</p>

<p>“You are wanted here on urgent business. Come directly
you receive my telegram.”</p>

<p>“That will do. Mind your spelling,” was her ladyship’s
comment. “Now you can go.”</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth was breakfasting at his club in
luxurious bachelor ease when his wife’s message reached
him, and he uttered an exclamation of annoyance and
surprise.</p>

<p>“How confoundedly unfortunate! And I dare say it
is only some fad of Pauline’s, after all. She likes to have
men running after her. I think I’ll telegraph back that
I am particularly engaged, and can’t leave town.”</p>

<p>Then he suddenly recollected that with all Lady Teignmouth’s
caprices, she had never sent for him in this way
before, and he at once decided to go. He telegraphed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
back to this effect, then finished his breakfast as quickly
as he could, and in less than an hour was on his way to
Bridgton.</p>

<p>Pauline had calculated about the time he would reach
the station, and had gone there to meet him, like a dutiful
and affectionate wife.</p>

<p>“Dear Reggie, how very kind of you!” she exclaimed,
her face in a glitter of smiles. “I never expected you
at all.”</p>

<p>“Then you did not come to meet me, Pauline?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did, you foolish fellow! The mere
chance that you would come was enough to rouse my
wifely zeal. Do you know why I wanted you?” she
added, as she took his arm, and led him out of the station
into the quiet lanes.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea.”</p>

<p>“No? Then I will tell you. I want you to take me
away from Bridgton immediately.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Pauline, you came here without me,
and could, therefore, leave here without me, surely.”</p>

<p>“You don’t evidently know Lady Lenox. She has
made up her party, and won’t hear of any one deserting,
as she calls it. I talked till I was tired, and then it
suddenly struck me to telegraph for you, and make believe
you had come on purpose to fetch me.”</p>

<p>“But how is it you are tired of Bridgton already?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to tell you, Reggie. You know how I
hate to give anybody pain.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he said, coloring a little. “Make a clean
breast of it while you are about it. Have you and Lady
Lenox quarreled?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Then you have had disagreeables with one of the
visitors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“No; everybody had been charming, and shown me so
much kindness and sympathy in my trouble.”</p>

<p>“What trouble? I do wish you would not try to
mystify me, Pauline. You know I was never good at
riddles. I suppose your pug is dead, or you have found
your first gray hair——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reggie! don’t talk like that; you make me feel
dreadfully,” she interrupted. “I may have seemed frivolous
when all things went well; but I assure you I can
suffer with you, and for you now.”</p>

<p>He dropped her arm, and turned, and stared at her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Would you rather I told you the truth, Reggie?”</p>

<p>“That is what I have been begging you to do for the
last half-hour,” he answered impatiently. “But you seem
to enjoy piling up the agony. I suppose the long and
short of it is that Gwen is dangerously ill.”</p>

<p>“She was perfectly well three or four hours ago. No;
it is not that sort of trouble. Reggie. Gwen has disgraced
us cruelly.”</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth started violently, and his face grew
white to the lips.</p>

<p>“I will not believe it,” he said. “You never liked her,
Pauline, and are exaggerating a small imprudence into
a crime. I am sure she would be able to clear herself at
once, if she knew of what she was accused.”</p>

<p>“Then give her the chance,” answered his wife coldly.</p>

<p>And she told him the miserable story of Mr. Belmont’s
death, unfalteringly asseverating that the unfortunate
man had come to Turoy on Lady Gwendolyn’s
account.</p>

<p>“They had a meeting in the wood the very night of his
death, as some of the people hereabout can testify; and,
of course, his sudden and mysterious fate has caused a
great sensation. No one could suspect Gwendolyn of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
anything but an imprudence, as you say; but it’s the
sort of imprudence that ruins a woman’s reputation, I
am afraid. My own opinion is that Colonel Dacre followed
Mr. Belmont to Turoy, and, finding him to be a
successful rival, determined to get him out of the way.
But this is pure conjecture, and nothing of the sort came
out at the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Then there has been an inquest?” inquired Lord
Teignmouth, who felt as if the ground were giving way
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! and Gwendolyn gave her evidence with great
dignity and propriety—she was sure to do that, you
know. The inquest took place at four o’clock, having
been delayed by the post-mortem examination, and it was
proved that the unfortunate man died of poison, but by
whom administered there was no evidence to show, and
they gave an open verdict.”</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth put his hand confusedly to his head.
He was a man of sensitive honor, and the thought that
his high-bred, beautiful sister had been mixed up in a
painful story, that would soon be telegraphed from one
end of England to the other, made him furious. Moreover,
Mr. Belmont had always been looked upon as an adventurer,
and careful people hardly cared to have him at
their parties. Mrs. O’Hara herself had never acknowledged
the relationship between them until her brother had
come into a fortune, when he would have been useful, no
doubt.</p>

<p>He turned to his wife, and spoke with angry decision:</p>

<p>“You did quite right to send for me. I would not
have you remain in this neighborhood another day on
any account. I shall go and see Gwendolyn, and tell
her that my house is shut to her for the future, and she
must make a home elsewhere. The only thing would
be for her to marry, if she could find any idiot to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
her. Anyhow, I am not going to have her name mixed
up with yours. Thank Heaven she is my sister, and not
my wife!”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, indeed!” she murmured, resting her
dimpled chin on his shoulder, with a movement full of
the most seductive grace. “But you know that, with all
my faults, Reggie, I am not capable of that?”</p>

<p>“I begin to suspect all women,” he said gloomily.
“Gwen and I were everything to each other in the
days gone by, and I thought her so innocent and upright.
If any one had dared to tell me she was carrying on a
secret intrigue I would have knocked him down if he had
been a man, so sure should I have felt that he lied miserably.
But I suppose there is no doubting the fact
now.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth shook her head.</p>

<p>“Lady Gwendolyn denied it, of course; she was almost
justified in trying to save her reputation by a falsehood,
it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“There should have been no need for the falsehood,”
responded Lord Teignmouth sternly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but if we all did exactly what was right, dear,
what a delightful world this would be,” said the countess,
with the sweetest indulgence. “I always feel myself
that having so many failings of my own I ought to make
allowances for others. Gwen is but young yet, and was
led away. I have heard of Mr. Belmont as a man of extraordinary
fascination.”</p>

<p>“What, then? Gwendolyn was not a raw schoolgirl, to
be subjugated by the first handsome mustache she saw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; but, no doubt, poor darling, she became attached
to Mr. Belmont. Indeed, I have felt sure for the
last year that she had something on her mind, and I
have tried to persuade her to confide in me, but she always
repelled me. I wish she had, now, for, as a sensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
girl, she would have given up Mr. Belmont at
once if she had known how thoroughly worthless he
was.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any sign of her sense in this miserable
business,” replied Lord Teignmouth, who looked harassed
and dejected. “But we had better get on, Pauline; there
are your things to pack, and I know of old what a long
process that is.”</p>

<p>“Everything is packed,” replied his wife. “I felt sure
you would take me away, and so I made my preparations
accordingly. And, do you know, if we miss the
eight-o’clock train it will be impossible for us to get
away to-night?”</p>

<p>“Then we will stay at an inn, Pauline. I am determined
you shall not be exposed to any unpleasant
remarks at Lady Lenox’s. Moreover, I want to get to
the other side of the Channel as quickly as possible, and
hide my diminished head.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Reggie, dear,” she said, as if the idea
had only just occurred to her; “supposing you write to
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“I would rather tell her my mind.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she answered coaxingly; “it would be so
much better to do as I say. You are both quick-tempered,
and will make a scene between you, and, surely,
there will be nothing gained by that. Come, Reggie,
do listen to reason. It would distress you, I am sure,
to accuse Gwendolyn to her face, and yet, of course,
she must know the truth. Write her a decided letter,
and as you will be leaving England at once, she will not
be able to answer it, and then you will be spared all annoyance.”</p>

<p>“I would rather see her,” persisted Lord Teignmouth.</p>

<p>“What could you say to her if you did? She is perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
independent, and has a right to meet twenty men
in Turoy wood, if she likes.”</p>

<p>“And kill them afterward, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh! do hush, Reggie; it is dreadfully imprudent to
talk in this way out of doors, where you might be overheard.”</p>

<p>“What does that matter? Do you suppose we shall
be able to hide our troubles from the world?”</p>

<p>“Impossible, of course; but it is no use precipitating
matters. We shall have a few hours’ start of scandal
if we keep quiet, and I do want to be the other side of
the Channel when the morning papers begin to circulate.”</p>

<p>“It will be of no use, Pauline,” he answered, more
gently than he had yet spoken to her. “Wherever we
go they will follow and dodge us, and we shall be sure
to meet heaps of people who will think it kind to condole
with us. I am afraid I shall behave like a bear if
they do.”</p>

<p>“Then let us return to Teignmouth, dear.”</p>

<p>“It would be still worse there. We should have to
receive our neighbors as usual if they called, and they
all know Gwendolyn so well.”</p>

<p>“Only that friends would naturally be more considerate
than mere acquaintances.”</p>

<p>“Surely, you would rather go abroad, Pauline,” he
said, looking at her with some surprise.</p>

<p>“Infinitely, Reggie; but I wished to do what would
comfort you most. Only that I want you, as a special
favor, to promise that you will make no effort to see
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you are both proud and passionate, and
may speak words in the heat of argument that will make
it impossible you should ever be friends again; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
do not see why you should not forgive Gwendolyn later,
supposing she made a decent marriage, and showed by
her conduct that she really regretted the past.”</p>

<p>“You forget, Pauline, that some people will always
believe that she killed Belmont to hide her indiscretion.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, dear, you torture yourself unnecessarily. I
am sure nobody will ever believe that; it is so obviously
the deed of a rival!”</p>

<p>“And Lawrence Dacre is here, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he arrived the same night that Gwendolyn did,
and put up at the village inn.”</p>

<p>“My sister, and my friend—two out of the three people
I loved best in the world,” he murmured. “And
my wife may be as false as they, for all I know! It
is enough to make me wish I had never been born!”</p>

<p>Pauline caught the muttered words, and pressed closer
against his arm, her face uplifted to his.</p>

<p>“You must not suspect me, Reggie; I will not have
it! I have been a careless wife, I am afraid, because—because,”
very softly, “I thought you cared for Gwendolyn
more than you cared for me, and that discouraged
me; but she cannot come between us now, and I mean
to make you so happy! Will you try and forget all these
miseries, for my sake?”</p>

<p>All men are weak when they get into the hands of
a clever, unscrupulous woman; and Reginald St. Maur
was so loyal, that his wife must needs have a very tender
hold upon his affections, if only because she was his
wife, and he had wooed and won her in his youth. It
is true that a coldness had grown up between them of
late years; but he had always been ready to welcome
her back into his heart, and now that Gwendolyn had
failed him so cruelly, Pauline was his one last hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>He drew her to him, and kissed her thrice on the
lips.</p>

<p>“Try and make me forget,” he said, “and I will bless
you all my life.”</p>

<p>“Will you leave everything to me?” she asked, as
she rested her still beautiful face on his shoulder and
smiled up into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Gladly—thankfully, my love.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, come into my room and write to
Gwendolyn, while I bid Lady Lenox adieu, and make the
last arrangements for our journey. I only want to save
you pain, my dearest; and, indeed—indeed, it is best.”</p>

<p>He followed her passively into the house, and up-stairs.
Gently coercing him into a chair, she brought
writing materials, placed a pen between his fingers, and
then, stooping forward, whispered between two kisses:</p>

<p>“Do your duty, but do it gently; for whatever her
blame may be, you are the children of one mother, and
were all in all to each other once.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the reminder,” he answered gravely;
and then she rustled away, and left him to his painful
task.</p>

<p>When she returned, half an hour later, the letter lay
on the desk ready to go, and, as if she feared he might
draw back even yet, she caught it up and rang at once
for Clémentine.</p>

<p>“Put that carefully in the letter-bag,” she said, when
the woman answered the summons; “and then come and
put on my cloak.”</p>

<p>“Must I see Lady Lenox?” her husband asked, when
they were alone once more.</p>

<p>“You need not; she quite understands and sympathizes
with you. They are just going to sit down to dinner,
and we shall go away quietly and comfortably, and catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the eight-o’clock train. You see, dearest, I am not altogether
incapable if I am left to myself.”</p>

<p>“I never thought you were, my love,” he answered;
and paid her such a pretty conjugal compliment that
Pauline began to think husbands were not such disagreeable
creatures, after all, if properly managed.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn had passed a miserable night, only
to close her eyes to dream of the inquest, and suffer over
again the humiliation of feeling herself suspected, not of
actual murder, perhaps, but of having contributed in some
way to the wretched man’s doom. Through Colonel
Dacre’s stern gravity she had read the same cruel misconstruction,
and yet he was so reticent, so careful not
to compromise her in any way, she almost felt, too, as
if he were a friend.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the reminiscent torture made her start up
in her bed, again and again calling out that she could
not bear it; and she was glad when old Hannah came
in to prepare her bath. She was so perfectly unsuspecting
that when she found a letter on her breakfast-table later,
and recognized Lord Teignmouth’s handwriting, she
opened it eagerly, feeling as if it were a bright spot in
her gloom.</p>

<p>But as she read, the color faded out of her face, and a
startled, anguished look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Even he forsakes me,” she murmured, in a stifled
voice; and, sinking down beside the couch, she buried
her face in her hands and wept violently, passionately,
until the very strength of her emotion exhausted her, and
she lay still, wondering in her infinite desolation what
she had ever done that fate should be so hard upon
her.</p>

<p>The answer came at last:</p>

<p>“You set up an idol and worshiped it; and in fleeing
from temptation a worse chance has overtaken you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Pray, unhappy woman; it is your only hope. The whole
world has forsaken you, even your own kin; and, above
all, the woman whom you served yesterday by your silence,
and whose blame you bore for your brother’s sake.
You have no kindred, or friends; you stand alone; and,
therefore, need to stand firm, with your head well raised;
but how will you bear this terrible solitude for all your
pride?”</p>

<p>There was no answer to this question, unless she
heard it in the storm—voices that went moaning round
the house. A sudden peal of thunder shook the roof;
the rain came plashing down; and Gwendolyn, poor
coward! hid her face again, and stopped her ears.</p>

<p>She did not, therefore, either see or hear any one
approach, until a warm, strong hand touched hers diffidently;
and she lifted her head to let these tender words
thrill through and through her:</p>

<p>“My darling! love has become my master; and I cannot
live without you, as I told you before, so I have come
to claim you for my very own!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ALL FOR LOVE.</p>


<p>Lady Gwendolyn was too much overcome at this sudden
apparition. She could not speak for a moment; and,
taking her silence for encouragement, Lawrence Dacre
knelt down beside her, and lifted the hand he still held
to his lips.</p>

<p>“I have done with resistance,” he said; his eyes full
of gloomy passion. “Whether you take me, or leave
me, Gwendolyn, I belong to you—and you only now.
These last few days I have done nothing but fight and
struggle, until all the flesh has worn off my bones,” he
added, with a grim laugh; “and I’ll make an end of it
somehow. Do you hear me, child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; go on,” she answered, scarcely knowing what
she said.</p>

<p>“What more can I tell you? I should scare you, perhaps,
if I let you see all the wild, burning passion in my
heart, for your love compared to mine is</p>

</div>

<p>But I will teach you better when you belong to me. I
could not be satisfied with the lukewarm affections that
most women are ready to bestow on any man who has
proper notions with regard to settlements. I must find
some expanse in my wife’s heart to the jealous, exclusive
passion in my own, otherwise there would be no use in
living, that I can see. I never cared much about the
world, and am ready to relinquish all its so-called pleasures
if you bid me; but, then, I must have the return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
my soul craves—something more precious to me than a
crown and kingdom—your undivided love.”</p>

<p>His mellow voice made such pleasant music at her
ear, that Lady Gwendolyn had made no effort to rouse
herself so far; but when he ceased to speak, she lifted
her haggard, tear-stained face, and said, with somber resignation:</p>

<p>“What is the use of picturing impossibilities? You
know I could not marry you if I would.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You forget that I know your secret.”</p>

<p>“Now, you must explain what you mean by my secret,
Gwendolyn,” he said, with decision, as he lifted her
on to the couch, and sat down beside her. “Twice you
have thrown it in my teeth, and though I have tried
hard to find out what you meant, I have been unable to
do so. On my honor as a gentleman, I know nothing that
need prevent our marriage.”</p>

<p>His arm was stealing round her waist, but she pushed
it away, and faced him with a regal air.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Colonel Dacre!” she said impressively.
“It is true that I was only twenty the other day, but
I have seen a good deal of the world, and am not easily
deceived. From the first moment that you and I met,
I knew that you had something on your mind.”</p>

<p>“Few men reach my age without finding that they
have a good deal to remember and forget. In my hot
youth I committed plenty of follies, I dare say; but I
can safely swear that I never really loved a woman until
I saw you.”</p>

<p>“And never deceived one, Colonel Dacre?”</p>

<p>“Never—as I hope for heaven!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!—hush!” she exclaimed, her eyes flashing.
“You are deceiving me now.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Gwendolyn, I have not even prevaricated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Let me know of what I am accused, that I may
defend myself; it is not fair to insinuate things of such
moment to me without making it possible for me to
explain.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said; “you shall hear my story from
the beginning. You remember the day that I was frightened
by Bates’ bull?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did not sprain my ankle.”</p>

<p>“I guessed as much,” he answered coolly.</p>

<p>“But I was anxious to find or make some excuse for
getting into Borton Hall.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why?”</p>

<p>“We were coming to that. The evening before we
were speaking, if you remember, of most people having
a skeleton or two in their cupboard, and you suddenly
turned very grave. When I laughed, and said that you
looked as if you had a dozen, at least, in yours, you
answered, with deep meaning, that one might be as much
as any one could bear. You were very silent for the
rest of the evening, and I was puzzled, stimulated, pained,
all together.”</p>

<p>“What, then?” he urged, as she came to an abrupt
pause.</p>

<p>“I took care to sprain my ankle in flying from Bates’
bull.”</p>

<p>“Then you were not frightened by the animal?”</p>

<p>“I did not particularly like the look of him, but I
should have passed him valiantly enough if I had not
seen you coming.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You carried me into your house, and laid me on a
couch, while you went for assistance. I had almost a
mind to laugh in your face when you bent over me so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
anxiously at parting, and made me promise to ring for
your housekeeper, supposing the pain should increase.”</p>

<p>“You played your part splendidly, I must own.”</p>

<p>“Of course! for I had a good deal at stake. It was
necessary for my peace of mind to discover the skeleton
in your cupboard.”</p>

<p>“And you succeeded?” he inquired, with suppressed
eagerness; his lips whitening as the words passed through
them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. With all my faults, I would never have
searched your place, of that you may be sure; but there
was no need, the revelation I sought was thrust upon me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>And though there was the gloom of an abiding sorrow
in his eyes, there was no shame nor shrinking—excepting
so far as we all shrink when a deep wound is
probed.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was the intervention of Providence,” Lady
Gwendolyn went on. “If you had asked me to marry you
an hour before I should have accepted you without hesitation,
whereas, it was not even right for us to be
friends.”</p>

<p>“You forget that you have explained nothing yet,”
he said hoarsely. “And yet, this suspense is very cruel.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean to be cruel,” she said. “I can assure
you I have suffered too much myself to take pleasure
in another person’s pain; but I am reluctant to recall
that most miserable half-hour I passed at Borton Hall.
I entered it so full of hope; I left it feeling as if I had
nothing to look forward to in the world, since you, whom
I had trusted and loved, were false.”</p>

<p>“Or, rather, you fancied so.”</p>

<p>“It was no fancy, unfortunately. I saw and spoke to
your wife.”</p>

<p>“Saw and spoke to my wife?” he repeated. “My dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Gwendolyn, you are certainly dreaming. I have no
wife.”</p>

<p>“She told me that her husband refused to acknowledge
her, and that, having no one to befriend her, she could
not assert her rights,” pursued Lady Gwendolyn, without
heeding his denial. “And, poor thing! she quite wrung
my heart, she looked so dejected and hopeless.”</p>

<p>“But not through any fault of mine.”</p>

<p>“Why do you try to deceive me, Colonel Dacre? When
a man has committed such a wrong as you have done, the
only atonement he can make is a full confession. Treat
me frankly now, and I will forgive you everything.”</p>

<p>“Forgive everything! What do you mean, Gwendolyn?
I want your love, not your forgiveness. I do not
deserve the former, I am aware; but I have certainly done
nothing to make it necessary for me to claim the latter.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you look upon bigamy as a very small offense.”</p>

<p>“But I have never committed bigamy, Gwendolyn. Indeed,
until I saw you I never wanted even to commit
matrimony.”</p>

<p>“Then who was it I saw in your house?”</p>

<p>“I have a crazy protégée in the village, whom I allow
to wander about the park, as she is perfectly harmless.
She has very strange delusions, and may have taken it
into her head that she is married to me, and I am trying
to keep her out of her rights. Who shall answer for the
hallucinations of a disordered brain?”</p>

<p>“The person I saw was a lady,” said Lady Gwendolyn.
“That is a point upon which it was impossible for me to
be deceived, of course. She was unusually delicate and
refined looking, and her accent was perfect. Your
protégée in the village could never have managed to play
the lady so well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. Mad people are very cunning
and imitative.”</p>

<p>“Still, they cannot perform impossibilities. Let her
imitation have been ever so good, she must have betrayed
herself in some way.”</p>

<p>“If you had suspected her, you would have perceived
certain deficiencies that passed unnoticed under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Impossible. I knew nothing whatever about her, and
was ready to believe anything. The impression she made
on me was, as I said before, of an extremely refined, lady-like
person, and I have no doubt in my own mind that she
was a gentlewoman, and your wife.”</p>

<p>“She may have been a gentlewoman, but she was certainly
not my wife,” replied the colonel.</p>

<p>“Will you swear that?”</p>

<p>“I will swear by my mother’s memory—which I love
and revere—that I never had a wife.”</p>

<p>“Will you swear also that you do not know the lady
I have been describing?”</p>

<p>“No; for I did not see her.”</p>

<p>“But you know whom I mean?” persisted Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>“I know nothing,” was the evasive reply. “I was not
present at your interview, and had no reason to suppose
there was any one in the house who would dare to make
such a charge against me. As I said before, I do not
pretend to be a saint, but I have never wronged or deceived
a living woman.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could believe you,” she said, almost convinced
in spite of herself, there was something so trustworthy
about him. “I want a friend and protector badly
enough, for my brother has deserted me.”</p>

<p>“What, Teignmouth!” exclaimed her companion incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; he thinks I have disgraced him, and the name
I bear, and does not care for me to be associated any
longer with his innocent, pure-minded wife, lest I should
contaminate her.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn would have been less than a woman
if she had not allowed her sneer to be perceptible—for
she owed all her misery and humiliation to Pauline; and
to know that she had managed to exalt herself in Lord
Teignmouth’s eyes at the expense of his sister, did not
give her a very Christianlike feeling toward the clever
countess, assuredly. But, having relieved herself by this
little piece of spite, Gwendolyn melted into tears again,
and was so agitated she did not notice the arm that was
stealing round her waist so gently.</p>

<p>Nor did she resist when presently, grown bold by impunity,
Colonel Dacre drew her head down on to his
breast and murmured:</p>

<p>“If you must weep, darling, you shall weep here. I
hold you fast now, and will not be denied. Cannot you
trust me a little?”</p>

<p>She shook her head drearily.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I could not. I should always feel as if
there were some mystery between us—and that would
spoil all my happiness. Besides, you do not respect
me, Lawrence; you told me so frankly two years ago.
What kind of marriage could ours be, distrusting each
other mutually, as we should do?”</p>

<p>“I should never mistrust my wife.”</p>

<p>“Not during the honeymoon, perhaps; but afterward,
when you could reason coolly again, would you not remember
the past, and be inclined to throw it in my
teeth?”</p>

<p>“You do not give me credit for much generosity,
Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“I think you are a man,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“And all men are scoundrels, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No; but they are sensitive on certain points. You
may not be a Cæsar, but I fancy you would not care to
have your wife suspected, for all that?”</p>

<p>“I do not see why you should be suspected.”</p>

<p>“It is a cruel world, remember. When people saw
me pass on your arm, the women would say: ‘Poor fellow!
he married Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur out of pity,
because nobody would have anything to say to her after
that wretched affair at Turoy. I wonder if she really
did poison Mr. Belmont? She looks like that sort of
person, does she not?’ A few men would make excuses
for me, perhaps—men do judge more mercifully than my
sex; but their voices would soon be drowned by their
wives’ shrill chorus of dispraise. You see, Colonel Dacre,
it is better I should live and die alone.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it is better you should belong to me,
as you need a defender.”</p>

<p>“Who excuses himself accuses himself,” she answered
sadly.</p>

<p>“And that was why you were silent yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No; I had a far different reason.”</p>

<p>“Will you not confide in me a little?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Why should I? In the first place, you do not treat
me with confidence; in the second, all I could say would
never persuade you that it was not I who had meetings
in Turoy Wood with Mr. Belmont.”</p>

<p>“I do not see who else it could have been.”</p>

<p>“And the lady I met at Borton Hall—who else could
she have been but your wife?”</p>

<p>“She might have been any one.”</p>

<p>“So might Mr. Belmont’s friend.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. You are the only lady in
Turoy.”</p>

<p>“Now!” she said, with a significance that made Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Dacre ponder, and wonder if he had been confused like
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>After all, he could not prove that Lady Gwendolyn
had been the only person in the Grange that evening;
and though the lady he had seen in the wood with Mr.
Belmont resembled the other in figure and style, he remembered
now that he had not seen her face, and had,
therefore, no right to judge her.</p>

<p>How could he have been so cruel as not even to have
given her the benefit of the doubt? And, after all, she
might be innocent, poor darling!</p>

<p>He pressed her to his bosom with a passion of tenderness,
as he murmured:</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling! You can never forgive me for having
misjudged you so, and yet I loved you like a madman
all the while.”</p>

<p>There was such a blessed rest in the love he proffered;
and she yearned beyond words to gather it up to her
heart. But believing him to be the husband of another
woman, it was her duty to put this comfort away from
her, and she dared not hesitate for conscience sake.</p>

<p>She withdrew one of his arms resolutely.</p>

<p>“You must try and get over your love,” she said, with
evident effort; and the utter desolation of her face would
have touched a heart of stone. “I will not take another
woman’s just place.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid that I should be base enough to ask
such a thing of you!”</p>

<p>“You are asking it now.”</p>

<p>“You would trust a madwoman rather than me?” he
said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must. The madwoman had nothing to
gain by deceiving me, and you have.”</p>

<p>“You forget that what I had gained by fraud I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
not be able to keep. If I were a married man there are
people in the world who must know about it. It is rare
that a woman is entirely without family and protectors,
and can be kept out of sight without somebody requiring
to know what has become of her.”</p>

<p>“True,” Lady Gwendolyn replied; “but one has heard
of such things.”</p>

<p>“In novels.”</p>

<p>“In real life, too. One rarely takes up a newspaper
without hearing of some mysterious disappearance.”</p>

<p>“That argument is rather in my favor than otherwise,
Gwendolyn. If my wife had disappeared suddenly you
would have seen something about it in the newspapers,
according to your own showing, and there would have
been every effort made to discover her whereabouts, or
the manner of her death, if she were dead. Besides, it is
only natural to suppose that in the early days I should
have taken my wife to Borton, and introduced her to my
neighbors. You do not marry a woman on purpose to
shut her up; that would be an afterthought.”</p>

<p>“You could have gone abroad, and from there announced
her death.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but you may depend it is better to have a
skeleton in your cupboard, rather than a living creature.
One tells no tales, and the other might get one into some
very unpleasant scrapes. Come, Gwen, do not be so unbelieving.
I swear by all that is most sacred I have no
wife. Even if I had wished to conceal this fact from
the world in general I should certainly have confided in
your brother, and you may be sure he would not have
allowed me to visit at his house under false pretenses.”</p>

<p>“But, of course, you would not have confided in him if
you had wished to keep your marriage a secret.”</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn,” he said passionately, “you will wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
me out. If you would only trust me as I trust you. I
love you so dearly, my sweetest.”</p>

<p>The strong arms enfolded her lovingly, the tawny
mustache swept her cheek. For one brief moment she
yielded to his caress, her lips thrilling under his, then she
wrenched herself away from him, and fled.</p>

<p class="center">A FACE AT THE WINDOW.</p>


<p>Colonel Dacre waited for half an hour, hoping Lady
Gwendolyn would return; but when the time passed, and
there was still no sign of her, he concluded that she did
not want to see him again that morning, and went back
to his hotel. All day long he expected that she would
send him a little note, telling him when he might call
again; but his patience was not rewarded. The hours
dragged wearily, but they passed, bringing the cool,
sweet eventide, when the tired flowers went to sleep under
their sheltering leaves, and even the busy bees were abed.</p>

<p>“She will send or come now,” he said to himself, believing
that the lady of his love had too much independence
of spirit to regard conventionalities; he sat at the
open window, waiting still, and still in vain.</p>

<p>When the clock struck eight he decided that she intended
him to seek her, and went over to the Grange.
Old Hannah answered his impatient knock, and, in reply
to his question, said, quietly, that Lady Gwendolyn was
gone.</p>

<p>“Gone!” echoed Colonel Dacre. “I am sure she could
not have left without my seeing her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you saw her or not, sir,” continued
the woman, with perfect civility. “But she really
is gone.”</p>

<p>“She did not leave any letter for me, then?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know, sir; but perhaps you would like to
step into the drawing-room and see?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre accepted this offer eagerly.</p>

<p>Old Hannah stood at the door, and watched him as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
he turned over the books, and even looked into the vases
on the mantelpiece, coming back to her, at last, with a
very disappointed air.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Lady Gwendolyn has written by the post,”
he said. “I hardly think she would have left Turoy
without giving me notice.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said the woman calmly.</p>

<p>This was a straightforward question, undoubtedly, and
only required a straightforward answer; but the Sphinx’s
riddle could hardly have puzzled Colonel Dacre more.</p>

<p>He had to ponder a long time before he answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, at last, “I have had the honor of
knowing her ladyship for some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“And I am one of her brother’s best friends.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>“And—and——”</p>

<p>Here he stopped short. Old Hannah’s responses were
so short and unsympathetic that they checked his fluency.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more you want, sir?” inquired old
Hannah, with exasperating tranquillity; “because, if not,
me and my husband would be glad to go to bed. We
aren’t accustomed to late hours, like fashionable folks.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre slipped a couple of half-crown pieces
into her hand.</p>

<p>“Put those under your pillow, to make you sleep,” he
said.</p>

<p>Old Hannah turned them over two or three times,
and then handed them back, resolutely and reluctantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for money I haven’t earned,” she said.
“When people seek to bribe you, you’re an idiot if you
don’t guess what they mean. You want to know where
my mistress is gone, and you fancy I can tell you; but
I can’t, and, if I could, I wouldn’t. I don’t need instructing
just when to hold my tongue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Dacre looked baffled and annoyed, although
he felt that the woman was right.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you make so much mystery about Lady
Gwendolyn’s movements,” he said. “Secrecy always excites
suspicion.”</p>

<p>“I have never knew the person yet who ever dared to
suspect my mistress,” she answered proudly. “Anyhow,
nobody can tell what they don’t know. Her ladyship left
about five o’clock this evening, and it warn’t my place to
ask where she was going. If it had been necessary for
me to know, she would have told me, of course.”</p>

<p>“What orders did she give about forwarding her letters,
then?”</p>

<p>“None, sir. My husband did venture to ask her that
question, but she told him she did not expect any.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre began to understand, at last, that Lady
Gwendolyn was fleeing from a temptation she could not
resist, and an expression of triumph darkened his handsome
eyes. When he found her he would command
rather than plead, for she belonged to him by right of
their mutual love.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed in this thought that he quite forgot
where he was, until old Hannah inquired, tartly, if he was
going to stay all night, when he apologized with a pleasant
laugh and said, as he proffered the two half-crowns
again:</p>

<p>“You may accept them with a clear conscience now,
for you have fairly earned them. I would give twenty
pounds myself gladly for an hour of good, honest, tranquil
sleep, such as I have deprived you of.”</p>

<p>“La! sir,” said old Hannah; “then why don’t you go
home and go to bed at once?”</p>

<p>“Because it would be of no use. I should only turn
and toss about until morning.”</p>

<p>“How funny! I never turn until I turn out of bed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Perhaps you’ve got something on your mind, sir. There
was Joshua Billing, in our village, who murdered his
wife; he was that miserable he couldn’t lay of nights, and
got up and hanged hisself at last, leaving a letter to say
that his wife haunted him, so he couldn’t abide his life.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I haven’t murdered my wife,” said Colonel
Dacre, in spite of himself. “The fact is, I haven’t a wife
to murder.”</p>

<p>“Ah! poor gentleman, that accounts for your looking
so bad!” returned Hannah, who had the fullest faith in
matrimony. “My husband would be a dreadful poor
creature without me.”</p>

<p>“I see, I must get married at once,” observed Colonel
Dacre, as he stepped out into the twilight, feeling, as old
Hannah expressed it, a very poor creature, indeed, without
this woman who had grown to be the light and savor
of his life.</p>

<p>He asked discreet questions at the railway station, but
the one solitary porter declared that no lady had come
there that day.</p>

<p>“In fact, sir,” he said, pocketing Colonel Dacre’s half-crown,
as if such munificence staggered him, “we have
no ladies, as a rule. Our station was made principally
for market fellows and farmers. When we haven’t no
passengers we signal, and the train doesn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“How often have they stopped here to-day?”</p>

<p>“Twice, sir.”</p>

<p>“And were there many passengers on these two occasions?”</p>

<p>“There was one lady for the twelve-o’clock express,
and that was all.”</p>

<p>“What was this lady like?”</p>

<p>“Rather stout, sir. Judging by the flour on her face,
I should say she was a miller’s daughter; judging by her
dress, I should say she was a duchess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“How did she come?”</p>

<p>“In Lady Lenox’s wagonette.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Colonel Dacre, and took a ticket for the
next station.</p>

<p>“It’s the late parliamentary, sir,” observed the porter;
“but perhaps you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am not going far.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find Bearstead a very out-of-the-way place,
sir,” pursued the porter warningly. “There’s only one
hotel, and that’s not at all the style of thing for a gentleman
like you.”</p>

<p>“You need not be anxious about me, I sha’n’t remain
all night. Is that the train now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Just as it drew up along the platform, a lady in black,
deeply veiled, stepped hurriedly into the station, and said
something to the porter in a low voice, no doubt slipping
a small coin into his hand at the same time, for he began
to bestir himself at once.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre was standing close to him when he labeled
the lady’s boxes, and found that she was going to
Preston, like himself.</p>

<p>As he was not in the mood for conversation, and knew
no woman could possibly keep quiet for three mortal
hours, he decided to get into a smoking-carriage.</p>

<p>He thought he had taken his precautions, and was congratulating
himself upon his forethought, when the porter
threw open the door of the very carriage in which he had
ensconced himself, saying, civilly:</p>

<p>“Now, ma’am, if you please.”</p>

<p>“But this is a smoking-carriage, porter,” interrupted
Colonel Dacre.</p>

<p>“All right, sir; that’s what the lady wants,” he answered,
somewhat disenchanted, but still deferential, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
he handed her in, and put her bag and dressing-case in the
seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I hope I don’t inconvenience you,” the lady began,
then stopped short, and held out her hand. “Why, Lawrence,
it is actually you! What an unmitigated piece of
good luck!”</p>

<p>And she threw up her veil, and showed the handsome
but bold features of Mrs. O’Hara.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre had always felt kindly toward Mrs.
O’Hara, in spite of her many faults and indiscretions,
and, indeed, during her married life she had been exceedingly
popular in the regiment, on account of her
unaffected good nature. Colonel Dacre remembered what
she had been, and forgot what she was, so that he always
found a cordial greeting for her when they came together.
Their hands met in a warm grasp.</p>

<p>“You can’t think how glad I am to have some one to
talk to,” she said, her eyes suddenly clouding with tears.
“You have heard of my poor brother’s sad death?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Norah, I never knew you had a
brother.”</p>

<p>“No; well, it was no use telling everybody,” she answered,
with some embarrassment. “He did not go on
quite as one could have wished, and of course it would
have annoyed Jack to have George talked about as his
brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“But after your husband’s death?”</p>

<p>“Then it would have looked odd, surely, to have suddenly
announced that I had a brother, as nobody had ever
heard of him before.”</p>

<p>“You know, Norah, I always think honesty the best
policy.”</p>

<p>“I started with the same notion, but I found out it did
not do,” returned Mrs. O’Hara sadly. “All the women are
against me now, because they say I am so gushing that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
talk about the first thing that comes into my head, and
so lead men away from their wives.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have heard you accused of that, certainly,” interrupted
Colonel Dacre, remembering the accusation Lady
Gwendolyn had made. “There was Percy Gray, for instance.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Hara blushed vividly.</p>

<p>“As you say that honesty is the best policy, I will admit
I did behave rather unwisely there. The fact was,
Lady Maria brought what happened entirely on herself.
Percy Gray hadn’t the faintest idea of falling in love with
me, until she put it into his head; but—would you believe
it?—when he was going to Norway fishing, she accused
him of intending to elope with me. The consequence
was that he couldn’t bear Lady Maria to tell a
falsehood, and he came off at once and asked me to
put her in the right.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do?”</p>

<p>“Ask Percy,” she returned dryly. “You know they
used to say in the regiment that Norah O’Hara liked a
piece of fun as well as anybody; but she’d make you remember
it if you went an inch too far. And, to do them
justice, our boys were all gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you weren’t always wise, Norah. I
used to wonder often that Jack stood it.”</p>

<p>“We understood each other so well,” she answered, her
eyes clouding again. “I can honestly declare that I never
had even a thought that wasn’t true to him from the first
to the last day of our married life.”</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence, and then she added tearfully:</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me how it really happened, Lawrence.
Lady Lenox was so very ambiguous and mysterious,
and though she means to save me pain, I dare say,
I always prefer to know the truth. She hinted something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
about Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur, and another
gentleman being jealous of poor George; but I could not
make anything of her story, and she would not explain.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Norah,” he answered, with grave impressiveness.
“Your brother is dead, and nothing can call
him back now. Take my advice, and do not seek to
know anything more, since it would only add to your
distress.”</p>

<p>“Not if I could avenge him?”</p>

<p>“That would be a terrible task for a woman.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I should like it. Indeed, if I could find
out that my brother had met with foul play, I would
hunt his murderer down, even if he were the best friend
I had ever had.”</p>

<p>“The game is not worth the candle, Norah.”</p>

<p>“I think so, at any rate, and am going to Preston on
purpose to consult a very clever lawyer there, whom Lady
Lenox recommended to me. Poor George left me all he
had, so that I shall be able to pursue the matter, if Mr.
Barnard advises me to do so.”</p>

<p>“And supposing you were to help destroy an innocent
person?”</p>

<p>“No fear of that. I am not quite a stupid, Lawrence.
And to show you I am not, I may just say that I don’t
believe Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur had anything whatever
to do with my poor brother’s death.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre could hardly restrain himself from seizing
her hand, and covering it with kisses, by way of
showing his gratitude for this speech.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy he even knew her,” pursued Mrs. O’Hara
decidedly. “But listen to me, Lawrence, beware always
of a cold-blooded coquette. You have been lecturing me
for my bad behavior, but I can assure you that I am as
harmless as a dove in comparison with a woman like that.
A cold-blooded coquette only cares for herself, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
having encouraged a man for her amusement, dismisses
him with a sneer the moment his passion becomes dangerous,
inconvenient, or stands in the way of a new conquest.
Whereas, I am such a poor, foolish thing, that I
always grow quite fond of a man who has been spooning
me a week or two, and cry when I bid him good-by.”</p>

<p>“I honestly believe you are not half as bad as you
seem,” returned Colonel Dacre, with a faint smile. “But
tell me, Norah—you know it will not go any further—have
you the least reason for suspecting any one of having
caused your brother’s death?”</p>

<p>“If so, I have no right to speak of my suspicion,” she
replied, with a reticence that surprised him; it was so
entirely foreign to her character. “Come and see me at
the ‘Langham’ a week hence, and I may be able to tell
you something. But here we are at Preston.”</p>

<p>He helped her down, and they were standing rather
close together, her hand in his as he bade her good-by,
and expressed his hope that she would apply to him if she
required any assistance, when a veiled face bent eagerly
out of the window in the full light of a lamp. A gust
of wind lifted the gauze just as the train began to move,
and the woman drew back hastily; but not before Colonel
Dacre had recognized Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“WHAT’S IN A NAME?”</p>


<p>Colonel Dacre dropped Mrs. O’Hara’s hand as if it had
stung him, and darted forward mechanically, as if to catch
up to the train; but his companion’s frightened exclamation
restored him to himself.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake be careful!” she called out, grasping
his arm. “If you have left anything in the train you
can telegraph.”</p>

<p>He stared at her blankly, and answered in a confused
sort of way:</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is no use telegraphing, for I have no
idea where to find her.”</p>

<p>“Where to find whom?”</p>

<p>“Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t in our train, surely?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she was, certainly; but I caught a
glimpse of her face as it moved off.”</p>

<p>“But wasn’t it odd she did not speak to you, Lawrence?
I fancied you were near neighbors at Borton, and very
intimate.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he replied, in a vague way. “I saw Lady
Gwendolyn this morning; but she did not tell me she was
leaving Turoy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was a sudden caprice,” replied Mrs. O’Hara
carelessly. “But do you intend to stay in Preston to-night,
Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“No; I am going on, I think; but, really, I have decided
nothing yet. I had better see about your cab, had I not?
You are going to a hotel, I presume?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; to the ‘George.’ I shall see you a week hence in
town, shall I not?”</p>

<p>“If I am alive,” he answered emphatically. “I am quite
as anxious as you are to solve this terrible mystery.”</p>

<p>They had reached the end of the platform, and were
quite alone for the minute. Mrs. O’Hara turned and
faced him.</p>

<p>“Will you answer me one question, Lawrence?” she
said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied, flushing slightly.</p>

<p>“Are you in love with Lady Gwendolyn St. Maur? You
know you may trust me, for I am one of those people
who seem very frank, and yet never let out a secret.
As I am not supposed to have any I am never even
questioned, so that I am really as safe a confidante as it
is possible for any one to have.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t need a confidante, Norah.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” she said decidedly. “There’s no comfort
like talking over one’s troubles to a friend. I declare,
when I got into the train this evening, I felt as if my
heart were breaking, and now everything seems more
bearable. I must tell you that I had a hint a little while
ago that you were fond of Lady Gwendolyn, and what I
have seen to-night confirms it, so you may as well tell
me the truth.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, at last, diffidently but proudly, “I do
love Gwendolyn St. Maur with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Then I hope you may win her, if she is worthy of
you,” said Mrs. O’Hara, with a cordial smile. “I know
she does not like me, and thinks me a very dangerous
woman; but then I am the <i>bête noir</i> of all Lady Maur’s
friends.”</p>

<p>“Then do try and be more prudent for the future,
Norah. You know people always argue that there is
no smoke without fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“People aren’t always to be trusted, Colonel Dacre,” she
said, with affected formality. “One has heard of reports
that were entirely false.”</p>

<p>“In that case, you almost invariably find that it had
its origin in some imprudence.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she answered loftily, “you may put me down
for hundreds of those. I never could, would, or should
be prudent; it is not in my nature.”</p>

<p>“Then can’t you change your nature, Norah?”</p>

<p>“No; I hate being perfect, and I can’t bear being bored;
and if you lecture me any more, Lawrence, I’ll say something
spiteful about Lady Gwendolyn: that she paints her
cheeks—you know she has a lovely bloom—or dyes her
hair—nobody believes in hair nowadays—or anything disagreeable
I can think of at the moment; for I want comforting,
not scolding, to-night—I do, indeed; and what is
the use of a friend if he fails you in your need?”</p>

<p>“My dear Norah, I can assure you I meant to be
sympathetic.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be,” she answered, with a dry sob. “I
should feel for you if you had lost the only person in
the world who really cared for you.”</p>

<p>“You are not quite so unfortunate as that, Norah.
You know I have a sincere affection for you, for poor
Jack’s sake, and your own as well. The best proof of that
is my candor; for if I did not look upon you as a friend,
I should not dare to give you good advice.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said, holding out to him the hand
with which she had just dashed away her tears. “I
couldn’t be angry with you, if I would, for the sake of old
times. I hope you will be happy, Lawrence, with all my
heart, though your marriage with Lady Gwendolyn will
rob me of a friend.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the cab, and, as he waved a last greeting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
he little thought how and when they should meet
again.</p>

<p>The next six days were passed he hardly knew how.
He wandered from station to station on the Great Northern
line trying to obtain some trace of Lady Gwendolyn;
but without the least success. On the whole, he might as
well have looked for a needle in a haystack; but the constant
movement did him good, and kept him from absolute
despair.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the very force of his longing must
bring them together at last. And so, perhaps, it did; but
not as he had pictured and hoped.</p>

<p>It was the seventh day after his parting from Lady
Gwendolyn, and, mindful of his appointment with Mrs.
O’Hara, Colonel Dacre slept in town overnight, and proceeded
to the “Langham” at eleven o’clock the next morning.
After making due inquiries, he found that the widow
was not there, neither had the manager any letter from
her.</p>

<p>As that was the case, he left the hotel, saying he would
call again later; and in the evening he presented himself
again. This time he obtained more satisfaction. A young
lady had just arrived, who had given this name, one of
the waiters told him, and had a sitting-room and bedroom
adjoining, on the first floor, Nos. 5 and 6.</p>

<p>With the aid of an obliging and comely chambermaid,
Colonel Dacre found himself at No. 5 presently, and tapping
lightly with his knuckles on the door, received a
soft summons to enter. It was nearly dusk now, and he
could not see very plainly, still it struck him that the outline
of Mrs. O’Hara’s figure had grown very slender
in the past week to anything he could remember it these
last ten years. Nevertheless, he said, with assurance:</p>

<p>“I was quite afraid I should miss you, after all, Norah.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
This is the second time I have been to the ‘Langham’ to-day.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you should be disappointed a second time
also,” answered a voice as cold as ice.</p>

<p>“Mrs. O’Hara?” said Colonel Dacre, half inquiringly,
half apologetically. “I am afraid I must have made some
mistake.”</p>

<p>And he peered forward to obtain a glimpse of the face
that was purposely concealed from him. At this moment
a hand touched his shoulder from behind.</p>

<p>“Here I am, Lawrence. Have you been waiting long?”</p>

<p>“But surely there must be some mistake. They told me
this was the room Mrs. O’Hara had ordered.”</p>

<p>She turned to the waiter, who had followed her and
was about to light the gas.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me this was the sitting-room Mrs.
O’Hara had ordered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“But it is already occupied.”</p>

<p>He stared stupidly at the shrinking figure near the
fireplace, and then a bright idea seemed to strike him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there’s two Mrs. O’Hara’s, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that; but it isn’t a common name,”
replied the widow, with suppressed impatience. “Go and
inquire about it, will you?”</p>

<p>“Shall I light the gas first, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” interposed Colonel Dacre, for, although
he had not recognized the voice, it had left a strange feeling
of expectancy behind, and he longed to see the face
to which it belonged. Mrs. O’Hara was simply curious,
while her namesake, seeing, no doubt, that escape was
impossible, faced her tormentors boldly, like a hunted
animal brought to bay.</p>

<p>Somehow, Colonel Dacre was not nearly so surprised
as might have been expected, when the sudden light displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the stately head and beautiful features of Lady
Gwendolyn St. Maur. But he was surprised when Mrs.
O’Hara, waiting for the door to close upon the waiter,
advanced to the table, and said, in a tone of passionate
repulsion:</p>

<p>“So it is you, my lady? I wonder you care to be here,
although I do not wonder at your sheltering yourself
behind an honest name. You have said many spiteful
things of me in my time; but it has never been possible
to say of me, with truth, that I destroyed a poor soul
who loved me only too well.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” returned Lady Gwendolyn,
with all the hauteur of her race.</p>

<p>“No? Then I will endeavor to make myself intelligible.
I have just returned from Turoy.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was all attention, but not by a movement
of the eyelids even did she show interest or apprehension.</p>

<p>“I went there in the company of my solicitor and of
a clever detective, whom he always employs when he has
any difficult business on hand. The result was to leave
us without the least moral doubt that my unfortunate
brother came to his death through you.”</p>

<p>A sudden flash brightened Lady Gwendolyn’s eyes,
but she answered quietly:</p>

<p>“Pray go on. I suppose you are prepared to prove
what you have just stated?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Mrs. O’Hara admitted; “but we are fast
collecting evidence.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a pity to warn me?” inquired Lady Gwendolyn,
with quiet scorn. “By the time you have collected
your evidence I may have made my escape, you know,
since ‘forewarned is forearmed.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Hara looked startled. She had never thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
of that. Lady Gwendolyn smiled to herself as she walked
up to the mantelpiece and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The waiter came hurrying back, and began, directly he
entered the room:</p>

<p>“There are two Mrs. O’Hara’s, ma’am. I thought
there must be. The other lady’s rooms are twenty-seven
and twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>“Then pray show her there,” interrupted Lady Gwendolyn,
turning her back coolly upon the above-mentioned
lady.</p>

<p>As to Colonel Dacre, she had never once vouchsafed
him so much as a glance. It was sufficient for her that
he had come to the “Langham” to meet Mrs. O’Hara,
and sanctioned the other’s accusations by his silence.
When the room was, as she believed, clear, she flung herself
into the nearest chair, with the passionate, indignant
air of a woman who feels that she has been insulted as
well as injured.</p>

<p>She had no idea Colonel Dacre had remained in the
room until he touched her arm, half-deprecatingly, and
said:</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn, I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>She turned upon him almost fiercely then.</p>

<p>“You can have nothing to say that I should care to
listen to, Colonel Dacre. You came here to meet Mrs.
O’Hara, and therefore I should be extremely sorry to
keep you from her.”</p>

<p>“As you know, Mrs. O’Hara and myself are old
friends,” he answered quietly. “And when she asked
me to meet her here upon business, I had no excuse for
declining, especially as I was much interested in Mr.
Belmont’s fate on her account. All this past week I have
been searching for you most anxiously, and have had no
satisfaction excepting a passing glimpse of your face at
Preston station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“When you were escorting Mrs. O’Hara somewhere,
and flirting with her publicly,” put in Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>“I was simply bidding her good-by when you saw me,
and that is a ceremony which may very well take place
in public.”</p>

<p>“Under ordinary circumstances.”</p>

<p>“The circumstances were by no means extraordinary
in our case, Gwendolyn. I met her by chance; we traveled
together for a couple of hours; what more natural
and commonplace? I have known Mrs. O’Hara for the
last ten years, her husband was the best friend I ever
had in the world. Would you have had me treat her like
a stranger?”</p>

<p>“I have no right to dictate to you,” she answered
coldly.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you have every right, Gwendolyn, since I have
asked you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“You forget that I declined the honor.”</p>

<p>“I did not understand you so. You coquetted with my
impatience as women are fond of doing, and finally left
me in suspense; but you never absolutely refused me.”</p>

<p>“Then I will repair my omission. I beg to thank you
for the honor you have done me in asking me to be your
wife,” she said, with great formality; “but I have no
wish to marry, and have not the confidence in or affection
for you that would induce me to change my resolution.”</p>

<p>Although there was a certain insolence in her manner
most men would have resented bitterly under the circumstances,
he felt too sorry for her, and for himself,
to resent what she said. She was casting away not only
her happiness, but her safety, and he knew why. In his
heart he felt sure that Lady Gwendolyn would have
accepted him but for his unfortunate rendezvous with
Mrs. O’Hara. He forgot that “trifles light as air are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ”;
and she had seen him at Preston station making, as
would seem, a very public display of his regard for the
handsome widow.</p>

<p>And Lady Gwendolyn was one of those women who
would forgive a blow better than she would forgive the
least shadow of unfaithfulness. It was useless to make
excuses, Colonel Dacre knew, for she would believe her
own eyes better than his words; but he could not help
saying, deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“I have done nothing to forfeit your confidence, Lady
Gwendolyn; but if you do not like me, you are right to
deny me. I had hoped different, for—for”—his voice
breaking—“I have loved you very dearly. How much,
you may, perhaps, know one of these days. I seem to
have nothing to hope for in the world now, and yet I do
not wish to leave it; because, dreary as my life must
needs be, it may still be brightened over in a way by a
glimpse of your face.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think you would have no brightness
beyond that,” she answered coldly. “But I am sure
Mrs. O’Hara will take good care of you in every way.”</p>

<p>“Has it not occurred to you that Mrs. O’Hara and myself
may never meet again after to-day?”</p>

<p>“Of course it has not,” she said. “There is nothing to
prevent your spending the rest of your lives together.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, there is one insurmountable impediment.”</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him with a sort of suppressed
eagerness in her eyes; but she was too proud to question
him outright. However, he saw that she wished him to
tell her, and went on:</p>

<p>“The thing that stands in the way of such a consummation,
and makes it impossible, is the disinclination on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
each side. Norah O’Hara, as I told you once before,
could never be anything to me but my friend’s widow,
and I could never be anything to her but her husband’s
friend. I would go a long way to serve her, for the
sake of old times; but as to marrying her——However,
I ought not to speak in this way,” he added quickly.
“Assuredly Mrs. O’Hara would not marry me if I wished
it ever so much.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>In spite of the confidence with which he had spoken
this question staggered him. It had never occurred to
him as possible that Mrs. O’Hara could care for him
otherwise than he had said, and yet the suggestion made
him uneasy. No man was ever less of a coxcomb, but
he was not a fool, either, and this hint had opened his
eyes. He began to recall things Mrs. O’Hara had said
and done, her evident animus against Lady Gwendolyn,
and a sudden, painful instinct of the truth began to dawn
upon him.</p>

<p>A scarlet flush mounted to his brows, and he lowered
his head under Lady Gwendolyn’s searching glance. He
was so chivalrous naturally that it pained him to think
Mrs. O’Hara had betrayed her secret, since this must
needs be such a deep humiliation to a proud spirit like
hers.</p>

<p>Finding he did not answer, Lady Gwendolyn repeated:
“How do you know that?” as if she were determined
to have an answer.</p>

<p>“One can’t always give a reason for the faith that is
in one,” he returned evasively. “Anyhow, supposing
what you say were true, I could not help Mrs. O’Hara’s
feelings.”</p>

<p>“Unless you had encouraged them.”</p>

<p>“I have never considered it possible for any encouragement
of this sort to come from a man. It is your privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
solely, and it would be horribly conceited of us to usurp
it.”</p>

<p>“I do not see why a man should not be allowed to show
that he appreciates the favor shown him if he really
does so.”</p>

<p>“That is a different thing to giving encouragement, as
you call it. I like Mrs. O’Hara for old association’s
sake; we have always been upon very cordial terms since
her marriage to my friend; but as to anything else, I
declare on my honor it has never so much as entered
my head.”</p>

<p>“If it had, it is no affair of mine, Colonel Dacre,” she
answered frigidly. “Mrs. O’Hara is lucky in having a
friend, for she certainly needs somebody to give her
good advice. It is not either usual or safe to make
accusations you cannot prove. If she does me the honor
of being jealous of me, and wishes to drive me out of
England, she has gone the wrong way to work, for I
mean to take a house in London, and live as much en
evidence as possible. If Mrs. O’Hara or any one else
can prove that I ever spoke to Mr. Belmont in my life,
let them do so; but I think they must commence by this.
One does not become terribly in love, frightfully jealous,
and murderously angry with a perfect stranger, you
know.”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. O’Hara finds that you and her brother were
perfect strangers, she will withdraw her accusation, of
course. And, meanwhile, being false, it need not trouble
you.”</p>

<p>“It does not trouble me in the least,” she answered
defiantly. “Only give your friend Mrs. O’Hara this
word of warning from me: every scandalous word I can
trace to her I will make her prove, or she shall take the
consequences.”</p>

<p>“I shall not probably see her again, Gwendolyn. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the moment she is your enemy she has ceased to be my
friend.”</p>

<p>A rosy flash, such as you see in the clouds at sunset,
passed over the girl’s beautiful face. She half extended
her hand, then drew it back, saying, with forced composure:</p>

<p>“I have no right to separate you two. Indeed, it would
be cruel if I did, since you and I can never be anything
more to each other than we are now.”</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn, you will drive me mad! I follow you
about like a dog, and get nothing but harsh usage in
return. Can’t you teach yourself to be merciful?”</p>

<p>“I must try first to be just.”</p>

<p>“A fig for justice! Who cares to even hear the name?”
he cried vehemently. “A woman is never just unless she
is supremely indifferent to the person she has to judge,
and anything is better than that. I want you for myself,
child, don’t you hear?”</p>

<p>He drew closer, and would have taken her hand; but
remembering how foolishly weak she had been at their
last interview, she took refuge on the other side of the
table before she would even parley with him. Then she
spoke out loudly and clearly:</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to appear harsh, Colonel Dacre. I have
a certain duty to perform, and I stand so entirely alone
nowadays that I am obliged to take a very independent
tone; but I would not give you unnecessary pain for
the world. Indeed, I am very grateful to you for believing
in me a little; but you know I have another reason,
besides the one I gave just now, for refusing to be
your wife. If you could explain satisfactorily about the
lady I saw at Borton, and this cruel slander had been
silenced, then——”</p>

<p>“Finish your sentence, Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Then I might, perhaps, marry you; but you see, at
present, it is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“That I deny. I see no just cause or impediment why
we should not be married to-morrow, supposing both of
us were willing.”</p>

<p>“But as we are not both of us willing, there is no use
in discussing the question any longer. I am so tired. It
seems to me I would give everything I am likely to possess
in this world for a few hours of oblivion and rest.”</p>

<p>And her face looked strangely haggard and troubled in
the strong, white light of the chandelier.</p>

<p>“Only that you are such a will-o’-the-wisp,” he said
complainingly. “If I let you go now, I shall never see
you again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” she said, with a faint smile.
“I begin to have a feeling as if I could not escape you
if I would.”</p>

<p>“Then why try?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Because I can’t help myself,” she answered, with a
blush; and then she added desperately: “You must
leave me now; I cannot stand any more—indeed I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to see me to-morrow, Gwendolyn?”</p>

<p>“I cannot promise anything, for I am too broken down
to realize the sense of what I am saying. I will see you
if I can, although these interviews only harass us both,
and do us no good. Still, since you wish it, I will try to
satisfy you, although I feel to-night as if I must be going
to have a serious illness.”</p>

<p>Her glittering eyes, white cheeks, and feverish lips
showed that there really was something wrong with
her; and Colonel Dacre looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>“You have done too much,” he said. “If I leave you,
will you promise to go straight to bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that I will, thankfully. Good night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>The table was not between them now, somehow, and,
before she had time to resist, he caught her in his arms,
and kissed her lips and eyes in a mad passion of love.
Then, without waiting for her reproaches, he hurried from
the room.</p>

<p>That night he stayed at the “Langham,” unknown to
either Lady Gwendolyn or Mrs. O’Hara. His mind disturbed
by the events of the day, he found it impossible
to sleep, and yet he knew he should be useless all day
unless he could get some rest for his aching brain. Finally
it occurred to him that his traveling-flask was full of
fine old cognac, and that, as physical exhaustion, as well
as mental worry, had something to do with his wakefulness,
some stimulant might help him through.</p>

<p>He therefore mixed himself a pretty strong dose—about
twice the quantity he would have taken ordinarily—and
then lay down again, his nerves wonderfully
soothed, and a pleasant languor stilling the riot of his
irritable pulse.</p>

<p>His last conscious act was to glance at the clock, and
say to himself:</p>

<p>“I must not sleep for more than three hours, at the
longest.”</p>

<p>And he fancied—but that must have been the beginning
of a grotesque dream—that the clock winked at him, as
much as to express, derisively: “We shall see.”</p>

<p class="center">A WILL-O’-THE-WISP.</p>


<p>Colonel Dacre thought it very wrong to swear, and
always denied himself this relief upon principle; but this
morning, when he opened his eyes full upon the clock,
which had a jeering, jaunty way of pointing at nine, he
certainly did feel as if an occasional indulgence this time
must be a pardonable offense.</p>

<p>He sprang out of bed, and rang at once for the waiter.
He was about to put some questions to him, when the
man handed him a couple of letters, saying:</p>

<p>“I was told to give you them directly you woke, sir.
Is there anything you want, sir?”</p>

<p>“Only have my breakfast ready in half an hour,” answered
Colonel Dacre, with assumed indifference; and the
moment the man had closed the door, he tore open the
letter that lay uppermost in his hand.</p>

<p>It was from Lady Gwendolyn, and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel Dacre</span>: <i>La nuit porte conseil</i>, you
say, and the result is that I think it far better we should
not meet. Pardon me if I have given you pain by this
decision. One of these days you will thank me for having
had the courage to deny you. I must mean to do what
is right, for I cannot help telling you that this is the
greatest sorrow of my life.</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Gwendolyn St. Maur.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The second was from Mrs. O’Hara, and was quite as
expressive in its way.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lawrence</span>: I see that you take Lady Gwendolyn’s
part: her false, fatal beauty has glamoured you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
poor soul! I must needs forgive you, for the sake of old
times; but I should only worry you with my friendship,
now that you have learned what it is to love, so that I
may as well get out of your way quietly. If you ever
want to see me again, I dare say you will be able to find
me; but, in any case, I have too deep and affectionate a
recollection of ‘auld lang syne’ to subscribe myself anything
but</p>

<p class="sigprefix">
Your sincere friend,
</p><p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Norah O’Hara</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“I have lost my friend and sweetheart both, by lying
too late,” said Colonel Dacre to himself, with a dreary
sigh; for he was not dolt enough even to inquire if the
two ladies were still at the “Langham.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre smashed the clock before he went down
to breakfast, and only smiled grimly when he saw that
five pounds was charged for the damage in his bill.</p>

<p>On second thoughts, he stayed where he was that day
because it was no use going anywhere else. He was utterly
discouraged now. The strength of Lady Gwendolyn’s
will frightened him.</p>

<p>He had fancied that all women were weak and yielding,
and here was one who made a resolution, and kept it,
as he believed, for duty’s sake, although her heart was
pulling her the opposite way.</p>

<p>It was quite a revelation, and somehow made him respect
all women more for her sake. He wished now he
had held her fast when she was in his power, and made
her marry him right off.</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth had forfeited all claim to be consulted,
and, though Gwendolyn hesitated and argued
now, he had a notion she would not have been sorry to
have had the decision taken out of her hands.</p>

<p>“Gwendolyn is just the kind of woman to admire a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
man who conquers her,” Colonel Dacre said to himself.
“But the least hesitation or weakness of purpose would
spoil all. She must see in me only the master who commands—not
the lover who pleads—or she will writhe out
of my grasp, somehow, even at the altar rails. Oh! if I
had only been wiser, and more understanding, how happy
I might be now!”</p>

<p>He determined to show Lady Gwendolyn that he had
some fertility of resource, and as strong a will as her
own, the next time they met; and with this view he
went off to Doctors’ Commons, and bought a special
license. Then, all things being fair in love and war, and
the position being very hopeless under its present aspect,
he descended to a ruse, which, under ordinary circumstances,
would have been unpardonable.</p>

<p>He put an advertisement in several of the daily papers,
so worded that only Gwendolyn could understand it, and
stating himself to be in such a condition, both mentally
and physically, that if, knowing all, she did not come to
him at once, his death would be on her conscience.</p>

<p>And then he waited.</p>

<p>“You will find me at the hotel where we parted yesterday,”
he had said; and, therefore, we may be sure he
did not quit his rooms for a second.</p>

<p>He sent for newspapers and books; but he was far too
restless to read. With his face glued to the window-pane,
he watched eagerly every carriage that drew up
to the entrance.</p>

<p>He had suffered breakfast and luncheon to go away
untasted; but when dinner was placed on the table, he felt
so strange that it occurred to him he must be suffering
from inanition, and he poured himself out a glass of
sherry, and emptied it at a draft. It felt like liquid fire,
and stung his throat; but the effect was magical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>His sluggish pulses quickened, the blood in his veins
seemed to dance vivaciously to the air of the delicious
waltz he had last danced with Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>The air was so full of her sweet presence he persuaded
himself she must be coming, and began to eat eagerly. He
would need all his strength to-night, and could not afford
to waste a single chance. But his appetite was not as
large as his aspirations. He got half-way through his
soup valiantly enough, then a sudden feeling of nausea
came over him, and he pushed away his plate, and rose
from the table, resuming his former place at the window.</p>

<p>It was growing dark now, but he could still distinguish
the passers-by; and when a lady alighted presently
from a cab at the door, his heart gave a great bound and
thrill.</p>

<p>For her figure was slender and graceful, like Lady
Gwendolyn’s; and she gathered her skirts over her arm
in a way he remembered well. But the light of the lamp
over the door fell full on her face as she turned to pay
the driver his fare, and then he gave a lamenting sigh.</p>

<p>The lady was not half as handsome as Gwendolyn; but
she was nearly twice her age, to make up. After awhile
it became so dark that he had to retire from his post of
observation, and then he passed the time watching the
door. Of course, he expected her every minute, and, of
course, she did not come.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre became in a perfect fever of expectancy
and apprehension as the night advanced; and as he still
found it impossible to sleep, he naturally felt exhausted
and faint.</p>

<p>Only that Gwendolyn might come while he was away,
and then, of course, she would find out his ruse, and then
there would be an end to his wooing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The only chance for him was to be on the spot at the
supreme moment, and take her by storm. So he stayed
at home, and when his sensations became unbearable, he
tried his remedy of the night before, and then stumbled
into bed.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">DOCTOR MAY’S PATIENT.</p>


<p>Colonel Dacre would never forget that night of torture.
The fever seemed to increase every hour, until the very
pillows felt as if they were burning hot, and he stepped
out of his tumbled bed, at last, and threw himself on the
floor. The only comfort he had was in repeating to himself
again and again: “She will come to-day—she will
come to-day!” But the day passed, somehow, and there
was no sign of Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>When the evening came round again he felt badly
enough to alarm him a little, and he made the waiter
fetch him a doctor. The pompous medico looked very
grave when he had felt Colonel Dacre’s pulse.</p>

<p>“Why, really, my dear sir, you must have been excessively
imprudent!” he said. “Where did you get your
cold?”</p>

<p>Lawrence answered him by another question.</p>

<p>“Have I a cold, then?”</p>

<p>“Aye, and with a vengeance. I doubt if you will be
able to leave your bed for another fortnight.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre uttered a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, doctor, it can’t be as bad as that. Do oblige
me by sitting down, and in ten minutes I shall be able to
prove to you that I am already on the high way to recovery.”</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. If his patient did talk a little nonsense,
it was natural enough. With such a pulse nothing
better could be expected of him.</p>

<p>“Or rather say you will be shortly, if you keep quiet,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
he said, with the diplomatic air of a man who is accustomed
to humor sick people’s fancies.</p>

<p>“Well, but what is the matter with me? I would rather
know the truth, if you please.”</p>

<p>“You have inflammation of the lungs, and as you have
evidently no constitutional weakness of the chest, you
must have been terribly reckless to get yourself in such
a state as this.”</p>

<p>“I am not conscious of having misconducted myself
as you suggest,” he answered dryly. “People are unaccountably
ill sometimes, surely.”</p>

<p>“There must be a cause.”</p>

<p>“That’s begging the question,” said Colonel Dacre,
ashamed to find himself so irritable. “You must really
excuse me, doctor, but my nerves feel so jarred, it would
be quite a pleasure to me to make myself disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“Do, by all means, if it would be any relief to you,”
returned the other cheerfully. “But I ought to tell you
that I fear you are on the brink of a very serious illness,
and that it would be better for you to get into a
quieter place while you can be moved.”</p>

<p>“But I am very comfortable here, doctor.”</p>

<p>“For the moment; but you will need more quiet than
you can get at an hotel, however well-conducted it may
be. You will be obliged to have a nurse——”</p>

<p>“Never!” he cried emphatically. “Sairey Gamp has
always been my bugbear!”</p>

<p>“So she has mine,” was the reply. “And, therefore,
all the nurses I recommend are comparatively young, and
are always bright and pleasant-looking.”</p>

<p>“And do they have a bottle of gin on the mantelpiece
to put their lips to when so disposed?”</p>

<p>“My nurses are teetotalers; all they expect in the way
of stimulant is plenty of strong tea, and I don’t imagine
you would grudge them that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Not if they drink it elsewhere; but I don’t want coddling,
doctor. I shall be all right again in a day or two,
no doubt.”</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be a Job’s comforter, but I can’t say
I see much chance of that. Anyhow, if you will stay at
this hotel you had better move into quieter rooms on an
upper landing. You cannot surely object to that?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre made this concession readily enough,
and as Doctor May found he was likely to be rather an
intractable patient, he gave the necessary orders at once.</p>

<p>In another hour Colonel Dacre found himself in new
quarters high up at the back of the house, where it was
cooler and quieter both.</p>

<p>He was given over to a chambermaid now, and welcomed
the amendment, for her step was lighter, her service
more gentle. She even showed a certain interest in
his state, and wanted to know if he hadn’t a mother, or
a wife, or any one to take care of him, sighing sympathetically
when he declared himself to be alone in the
world.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre thought the matter over very exhaustively
that evening. Doctor May, who paid him a visit
at about nine, had given him an opiate which soothed
his nerves, and kept him quiet, although it did not make
him sleep, and therefore he had plenty of time for reflection.</p>

<p>Strange to say, his head was singularly clear all that
night, but toward morning he found his mind wandering
off, and was very angry with himself, persisting in thinking
it must be his own fault.</p>

<p>When Doctor May called in the morning, Colonel
Dacre evidently looked upon his visit as an intrusion, but
was careful to be distantly polite.</p>

<p>“I have a vague recollection of having seen you before,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
he said; “but my memory is so bad I cannot recall
your name.”</p>

<p>“I am Doctor May; you sent for me yesterday, you
know,” answered the other quietly. “I am afraid you are
not feeling so well.”</p>

<p>“Nothing much the matter—all right to-morrow,” he
muttered hoarsely. And then he added, in a confidential
tone: “Will you do something for me?”</p>

<p>“Willingly, if I can.”</p>

<p>“Let them show her up directly she comes. She is
peculiarly sensitive, I must tell you, and the least delay—you
understand?”</p>

<p>“I understand,” repeated Doctor May, smiling reassuringly
into his haggard eyes. “You wish her to be
brought up-stairs directly she arrives?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre, usually one of the most reserved men in
England, seized his hand, and pressed it warmly. Then,
straightening himself as he lay, he said with the graceful
courtesy of a man of the world:</p>

<p>“I shall hope to see you at my wedding, doctor——”</p>

<p>“May,” put in the other.</p>

<p>“Doctor May. It will take place by special license
to-morrow at twelve. I can’t remember where at this
moment, but that is immaterial. However, I have a word
for your private ear.” Doctor May bent his head close
to the other’s lips. “She is the sweetest woman in England;
but she has one little defect—come closer if you
please—she—she——”</p>

<p>Doctor May looked at him compassionately as he sank
back on his pillow, muttering incoherently, for he greatly
feared that in spite of his iron frame, he would not be
able to pull his patient through, and it seemed hard he
should die in his prime, and die solitary and alone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">MY LOVE—MY LIFE.</p>


<p>When Doctor May left Colonel Dacre’s room, after
having given certain orders to the comely chambermaid,
he sought and obtained an interview with the manager
of the hotel. To him he represented Colonel Dacre’s
state, asking him if he could conscientiously guarantee his
having the attention and quiet upon which his life would
probably depend?</p>

<p>Monsieur Bause answered readily that the season being
over, and the hotel comparatively empty, Colonel
Dacre could have as much attention as if he were in his
own home.</p>

<p>“Only the maid servants now sleep on the landing to
which he has been moved,” pursued Monsieur Bause.
“When we are full we use some of those rooms for
bachelors; but there is no fear of our being put to such
a necessity in August.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure? Pardon me for persisting, Monsieur
Bause; but, you see, I feel Colonel Dacre to be
doubly dependent upon me, as he appears to have no
friends to share my responsibility. It would be a risk
to move him now, perhaps; but later on it would be certain
death.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, doctor, you need not be anxious on your
patient’s account. I will watch over him myself, and see
that all your orders are strictly carried out.”</p>

<p>And he looked so trustworthy, and capable of so much,
as if he could have managed a dozen sick-rooms and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
hotel at the same time. Doctor May could not help
saying:</p>

<p>“If you promise me that, I am sure it will be all
right.”</p>

<p>“You will have a nurse for the gentleman, doctor, I
presume?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly. I am going off at once to see about
one, and will endeavor to get her here in a few hours.
Meanwhile, the young woman who has been waiting upon
Colonel Dacre will be able to do what is necessary, and
I shall be in and out several times.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman is very ill, I suppose, sir?”</p>

<p>“Very ill, indeed. I doubt if I can pull him through;
and shall call in Doctor Forbes to consult with me, unless
there is a marked improvement to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on below, a
stealthy figure stole up-stairs to the room Doctor May
had just quitted, and paused at the door, listening. As all
was quiet within, the woman entered noiselessly, and
went up to the sick man’s bed. He lay apparently asleep;
and who shall describe the haggard, passionate face of
the woman as she knelt beside him, and bent down until
her golden hair mingled with his tawny mustache.</p>

<p>“My darling!” she murmured at his ear, “I know all
this is my fault; but only get better—only get better—and
we will give the world the go-by, and be happy our
own way. If only I were your wife, that I might stay
by you now! I am sure you would be well at once! and
oh! my dearest, I want you so badly, and I have only
you.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if these tender words penetrated to the
very heart of his sleep, for he stirred slightly, and muttered
a name in a yearning voice.</p>

<p>A light came over the woman’s face, and she smiled
faintly, but sweetly, as she bent lower still, until her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
lips brushed Colonel Dacre’s feverish cheek. Then, as if
scared by her own boldness, she rose quickly to her feet,
and with one backward look toward the bed, darted to
the door and disappeared, running straight into the arms
of Mary, the chambermaid.</p>

<p>“What were you doing in that room?” inquired Mary,
in a tone of just severity. “It’s no use me having my
orders, and being responsible for carrying them out, if
you are to interfere.”</p>

<p>A vivid blush mounted into the other’s beautiful face,
but she answered, quite humbly:</p>

<p>“I wanted to see him so much. You won’t tell of me,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Mary uncompromisingly, “if the doctor
asks me I can’t lie, you know.”</p>

<p>“He will be sure not; why should he? And I have
done no harm. Have you nobody you care for very
much?”</p>

<p>It was Mary’s turn to blush now.</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” she said. “Your duty
is your duty, and the doctor told me to keep the poor
gentleman perfectly quiet.”</p>

<p>“I assure you I haven’t disturbed him in the least.
Look in, and you will find he is still fast asleep.”</p>

<p>She pushed a sovereign into Mary’s hand as she
spoke, and the glitter of gold seemed to alter the girl’s
views and feelings. Her eyes and voice became charmingly
sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,” she said; “you are going to be married to
the poor gentleman. I’ll let you in as often as I can
manage it, but I am afraid the nurse will be a tougher
customer. However, I’ll do my best, miss.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered the lady softly. “I should be
very grateful, and you will not repent your kindness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>This time Mary dropped a curtsey. She began to see
that the other was a perfect lady.</p>

<p>“If you would tell me your room, miss, I would bring
you down news of the poor gentleman every three hours
or so. As I am to wait upon the nurse I shall know exactly
how he is going on.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I should be very glad. I am just below,
the first room on the right as you go down.”</p>

<p>“And what name, if you please?”</p>

<p>There was a slight hesitation, and then the answer
came loud and clear.</p>

<p>“Miss Mordaunt. And Mary——” hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p>“If he should be hopelessly bad, you will call me, will
you not? Even if it should be the middle of the night,
come to me all the same. I should die of a broken heart
if I were not to see him at the last.”</p>

<p>“I promise I will call you, miss; but let’s hope for better
things,” she added encouragingly. “He looks like a
strong gentleman, and I don’t suppose there’s any call to
spare expense.”</p>

<p>This she said to find out Colonel Dacre’s means, and
Miss Mordaunt’s reply was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world! He is a rich man, and
there is no reason why he should not have everything in
the world he wants.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that, poor gentleman! I’m sure I would
do anything for him whether he had money or not, he is
so kind and pleasant-spoken; but, then, in an hotel, they
have to be particular, and Monsieur Bause is only manager,
and is responsible to the company, you see.”</p>

<p>“Nobody could blame him for being particular,” answered
Miss Mordaunt; “but, in this case, he has nothing
to fear.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, miss, I am sure he hasn’t,” replied Mary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
with confidence. “And the poor gentleman will be done
justice by, for Monsieur Bause has already locked up all
his money and rings, for fear of accidents. Not that he
is afraid of our taking them,” she added quickly; “but,
you see, in a large house like this there are so many
people in and out.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! and it is better to be too careful than not
careful enough,” said Miss Mordaunt, casting a very wistful
glance toward the door of the sick-room, as she prepared
to depart. “You will come down and tell me what
the doctor thinks about Colonel Dacre this afternoon,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, miss; you may quite trust me. I shall be
in and out continually, even after the nurse comes.”</p>

<p>Miss Mordaunt went away then, very slowly and
softly, like a person who has a great trouble at heart,
and, looking after her, until only the tip of her aristocratic
nose was visible, Mary said to herself:</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if she is a duchess in disguise.
Anyhow, she is a real, born lady, and knows how to behave,
so I can’t do better than serve her; and if the
poor gentleman ever gets well, and he’s as fond of her
as she is of him, why, I dare say there will be something
coming in from both sides.”</p>

<p>Mary did not mean to be mercenary, and had good
feeling in the main; but she was going to be married as
soon as her young man could save up money enough to
buy furniture, and so every sixpence she could earn became
a precious acquisition.</p>

<p>The nurse arrived about four o’clock, and Miss Mordaunt,
who had been sitting with her door ajar all the afternoon,
examined her anxiously as she went past. She
had a firm face, but a bright and sympathetic expression;
and there was something in her upright carriage
that inspired confidence irresistibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Miss Mordaunt shut the door when the other had
passed, and sank into a chair, letting her nerveless hands
drop to her side.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” she murmured, “at least he will have
every chance.”</p>

<p>The next few days were days of indescribable misery
and suspense to the anxious watcher in No. 56.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre lay between life and death, and the doctor
came out of the sick-room always with a terribly
grave face. But for a little compromise she had made
with Mary, Miss Mordaunt would have fallen ill herself
with worry.</p>

<p>The nurse had four hours’ rest during the day, and
directly she was safely shut into her room, the girl ran
down to fetch Miss Mordaunt, and allowed her to take
her place at Colonel Dacre’s bedside. It was such a
comfort to be doing something. Only those who have
had to stand by helpless, when those they loved were
sick and suffering, will understand the poor girl’s thankfulness
for Mary’s concession.</p>

<p>The chambermaid would have got into sad disgrace
if she had been found out; but she was willing to run
the risk, as Miss Mordaunt’s gratitude took a substantial
form, and, moreover, she was really interested in the
lovers.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions Miss Mordaunt had a serious
fright. She had scarcely settled herself in the sick-room,
and was just measuring out the medicine that Mary
had been charged to give the sick man at this time, when
she heard Doctor May’s step and voice on the landing
below. He was evidently talking to Monsieur Bause,
and must have forgotten something, as he had paid his
usual midday visit before the nurse had gone to lie
down.</p>

<p>The color mounted in a flood to the girl’s delicate face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and her heart beat like a sledge-hammer against her side.
A discovery of this sort would necessitate all kinds of
painful explanations and humiliating confessions, and
she did not know how far Doctor May was to be trusted.
But while she stood hesitating, panting, confused, Mary
suddenly appeared on the scene, whisked the glass out
of her hand, pushed her toward the closet, and, closing
the door upon her, locked it softly. There was not even
room to stand upright, but Miss Mordaunt was too thankful
for her deliverance to take heed of such a trifle.</p>

<p>She crouched down in the easiest position she could
find, and listened with all her ears.</p>

<p>“Where is nurse?” inquired Doctor May, as he entered.</p>

<p>“It is nurse’s time for lying down, sir,” answered
Mary, in a voice that trembled slightly as from hurry
or surprise. “But if you have any orders, sir——”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten to tell her that I did not wish
Colonel Dacre to have any more of the medicine I sent
yesterday; I will let her have a new bottle in half an
hour, and she is to give him a dose of that directly it
arrives.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“Be sure you don’t make any mistake; or, stop, I’ll
take the other bottle away with me, and then it is sure to
be all right.”</p>

<p>He made for the cupboard, recollecting that the medicine,
etc., was kept on a shelf there, but Mary nervously
interposed.</p>

<p>“I know which it is, sir, quite well, and will empty it
directly, so that you needn’t trouble to take it away.”</p>

<p>Doctor May was a man of quick penetration, and
Mary’s manner seemed to him so suspicious that, although
he would have been quite satisfied with her arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
under ordinary circumstances, he resolved now
to investigate the matter for himself.</p>

<p>Moving her aside, he placed his hand on the key of
the door to turn it, when Mary, thinking she had done
all that had been expected of her, vanished from the
scene, leaving Miss Mordaunt to bear the brunt of her
own imprudence, and explain things as best she could.</p>

<p>Miss Mordaunt knew that detection was inevitable, and
would have been equal to the position even now if she
had only been on her feet; but what was to become of her
dignity while she crawled out of the cupboard? She
felt that it was impossible to overcome such a disadvantage,
so that when Doctor May threw open the door,
and, looking full into her eyes, said softly, but imperiously:
“Come out,” she gave all attention to her ankles,
and left her dignity to take care of itself.</p>

<p>When she had lifted herself up, and was facing him,
Doctor May looked at her with unconcealed astonishment.
Although her hair and dress were disordered,
and her face crimson, it was impossible to take her for
anything but a gentlewoman, and if he had expected to
find anybody it was a slim young waiter whom he had
caught once in earnest conversation with Mary on the
stairs.</p>

<p>A minute’s silence, and then Miss Mordaunt said
quietly:</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to explain, unless—unless you have
already guessed.”</p>

<p>“I think I have,” answered Doctor May, with a smile.
“But I am sorry you did not confide in me at once, as
I would have made it possible for you to see him without
hiding in the cupboard. Are you staying in this
hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, with some reluctance.</p>

<p>“What is the number of your room?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Fifty-six.”</p>

<p>“And your name?”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary to catechize so closely, Doctor May?”</p>

<p>“Well, the last question was superfluous, certainly,
for I knew you directly I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Knew me?” she repeated, the color mounting once
more into her face, and her lips trembling. “Oh! surely
not!”</p>

<p>“Why should you mind? As a professional man, I
am nothing if I am not discreet. What is more, I respect
and admire a lady of position who casts aside
conventionalities, and dares, for once, to listen to her
heart.”</p>

<p>“But the world would be very cruel if it knew all.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I really don’t know anything about your
world. But need it know all? You can surely remain,
Miss Mordaunt, for the present.”</p>

<p>“If you have recognized me, another might.”</p>

<p>“Then take care ‘another’ doesn’t see you. With ordinary
precaution, you need not excite attention. I presume
that you have been in the habit of taking Mary’s
place from the beginning?”</p>

<p>“Ever since Colonel Dacre was insensible.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Then the girl, being in your confidence,
will help you, of course.”</p>

<p>“And the nurse?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can easily manage her; she is not the kind of
woman to be astonished at anything. I shall simply
tell her that the lady to whom Colonel Dacre is going to
be married is staying in the hotel, and would like to see
him sometimes; and you will find you have only to present
yourself at the door to obtain ready admittance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Doctor May; only that if it
would excite Colonel Dacre to see me——”</p>

<p>“All the while he remains in his present state nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
can excite him,” replied Doctor May. “Directly I see a
change for better or worse I will let you know.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind. I am glad now that you know
all about it.”</p>

<p>And she held out her hand with pretty impulsiveness.
He lifted it respectfully to his lips, and then he let it fall
with a sigh, and found himself envying Colonel Dacre.
It was worth while even to be “sick unto death” for such
a woman’s love.</p>

<p class="center">A JOYFUL AWAKENING.</p>


<p>As we said before, only those who have watched by the
sick-bed of one they love better than themselves can picture
the next few days.</p>

<p>Doctor May had made the nurse understand that “Miss
Mordaunt” had a right to be with Colonel Dacre, and
the two watched every night together, expecting every
hour to be the last. Miss Mordaunt was worn to a
shadow with these anxious nights, for she did not even
rest in the daytime, like her companion. How could
she sleep through these precious minutes, which might
be the only comfort in the future—a memory that would
be more to her than any living love?</p>

<p>For she had sworn to be Colonel Dacre’s widow if she
was never to be his wife. Colonel Dacre had been ten
days unconscious, and hovering so close on the edge of
the “valley of the shadow,” that sometimes they thought
he had gone for good, and could never creep back into
the light again. But he had a strong constitution, and
fought every inch of the ground resolutely.</p>

<p>At last Doctor May said:</p>

<p>“There will be a crisis to-night. I see a great change
coming on, but whether for good or evil, I cannot tell
as yet, since the rally before death often deceives us for
the moment.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you remain with us?” inquired Miss Mordaunt
wistfully. “I don’t mean sit up, for I know you
oughtn’t to do that; but if you were sleeping in one of
these rooms close to us, it would be a great comfort;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and we need not call you unless it is absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p>There is not much men will not do for a beautiful
woman who knows how to manage them, and Doctor
May had long since lost the power of denying Colonel
Dacre’s fiancée. He had promised himself elsewhere,
but that did not weigh with him for a moment. He had
been dreaming wild dreams of late. Hearts were caught
in the rebound, and if anything happened to his patient,
why should not he take his place?</p>

<p>Of course there was a great disparity between them,
socially speaking; but he knew cases in which this had
been ignored, and Miss Mordaunt did not appear the
kind of person to stop at anything when she loved. He
was ashamed of himself, but he could not help the
thought. It is the fate of women who are so wondrously
fair to make all the men who come in contact
with them either dolts or knaves.</p>

<p>He turned to her with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“I will certainly remain if it is any comfort to you. I
will go at once and see a few of my most pressing cases,
and then return.”</p>

<p>“I can never thank you enough,” she murmured. “It
will be such a great relief to feel that you are near.”</p>

<p>By ten o’clock Doctor May had come back, and they
had settled in the sick-room for the night. Doctor May
had refused to lie down, and insisted upon keeping them
company, the truth being that he was too much interested
in the denouement to feel as if he could sleep.</p>

<p>There was a slight restlessness in Colonel Dacre’s
manner, but he still remained unconscious; and Miss
Mordaunt sat beside his pillow, with her anxious, beautiful
eyes fixed persistently on his white face. On the
opposite side Doctor May watched, too—not the patient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
but her—while nurse, relieved from all responsibility,
dozed comfortably.</p>

<p>At last the sick man’s eyelids began to tremble, and
Miss Mordaunt held her very breath for eagerness. Finally
he opened his eyes full upon her, and said, languidly
but without surprise:</p>

<p>“Are you here, Gwen?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she answered, with a thankfulness far too
deep for outward expression. “You must not talk; must
he, Doctor May?”</p>

<p>Doctor May was as pale as the sick man, as he lifted
his head to answer:</p>

<p>“Certainly not. The best thing for Colonel Dacre
now is sleep. Give him a few spoonfuls of beef tea, and
then keep him as quiet as you can. As I am not wanted
any more, I’ll go and lie down.”</p>

<p>The girl looked radiant, and there were tears of gratitude
in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t talk about things to-night,” she followed him
to the door to say; “but if ever there should be any
way in which I could serve you——”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lady Gwendolyn,” he answered, with
peculiar gravity; “you have paid me the greatest compliment
in your power by trusting me with your secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I wasn’t the least afraid.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for saying so. I shall never, of course,
breathe a word of all that has happened lately.”</p>

<p>“I know that. But how did you guess my name, Doctor
May?”</p>

<p>“You forget that your portrait is in almost every print-shop
in London, Lady Gwendolyn.”</p>

<p>“True; it is very impertinent of people, but my brother
said it could not be helped.”</p>

<p>“I shall hear of your marriage soon, I suppose?” he
ventured to say, emboldened by her gracious manner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
“and, believe me, Lady Gwendolyn, no one will pray for
your happiness more earnestly than I.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of that,” she replied, holding her hand to
him with a rosy blush. “But I do not know yet anything
about my marriage. You see, my brother is away,
and—there are certain little difficulties. But I am so
happy to-night, I can only look on the bright side; and
I feel as if things must come right. See, Doctor May,
Colonel Dacre is already asleep. Oh!”—with a sudden,
frightened glance at her companion—“is it sleep? He
looks so terribly like death! Do come and see!”</p>

<p>She drew him forward with nervous haste, and watched
him, with her heart in her eyes, as he bent over the sick
man and felt his pulse.</p>

<p>“It is all right—but he will look like this for awhile—he
is so terribly pulled down. However, he will get on
now, I believe. Try and get a little sleep yourself, Lady
Gwendolyn, for you need it sadly, too.”</p>

<p>“I am too happy to be tired,” she said confidently.
Nevertheless, when Doctor May was gone, and there was
silence in the sick-room, she began to feel drowsy, and
presently she was locked in slumber as soft as it was
light.</p>

<p>When once Colonel Dacre had taken a turn for the
better he mended very fast. But then he was so patient
and good, and took his medicine without so much
as a wry face. He wanted to get well quickly, for his
special license was ready, and he had a notion that Lady
Gwendolyn could hardly deny him now. But not a word
did he say on the subject, for fear of scaring her away;
and she just drifted along with the tide, hardly caring
where it landed her, so that it was close to Lawrence
Dacre.</p>

<p>One afternoon she had gone out to do some commission,
and as she was stepping out of the shop, she found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
herself suddenly face to face with her sister-in-law,
Lady Teignmouth. Pauline held out her hand with an
embarrassed smile.</p>

<p>“I declare, it is you, Gwen! What are you doing in
town at such a dreadful time of the year?”</p>

<p>“You forget that I might contaminate you,” answered
Lady Gwendolyn, refusing the proffered hand, and standing
up very straight. “It is a great pity you spoke to me,
Pauline, because I know how careful you are never to
conceal the slightest thing from my brother, and he will
be very angry.”</p>

<p>Pauline laughed—the hollow, artificial laugh that always
grated upon Lady Gwendolyn’s nerves.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so very absurd! No woman, with a grain
of sense, makes a confidant of her husband. Besides,
Reggie is quite coming round, Gwen; he is, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Very kind of him, I am sure,” replied her sister-in-law,
with a bitter smile. “Do you know, I feel quite
grateful.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth walked along at her side, and lowered
her voice to say:</p>

<p>“I dare say you do feel annoyed about it all; but it
really was best he should take it as he did, and I have
been a perfect model of discretion ever since. Reggie
and I get on charmingly nowadays; and just think what
a scandal it would have created, supposing we had separated!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">GWEN AND PAULINE.</p>


<p>“I see you are not changed, Pauline,” said Lady Gwendolyn;
“it was always self with you, and always will be.
My sufferings are nothing so long as you run no risk!”</p>

<p>“Oh! but you are not suffering, I am sure,” answered
Lady Teignmouth. “You are looking exceedingly well,
and handsome, and the whole affair has blown over so
comfortably, there’s no reason why you should not resume
your proper position in society. I am afraid Reggie
won’t let me chaperon you—at least, just yet; but
there is Mrs. O’Hara. She is not particular.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but I am,” returned Lady Gwendolyn, with
angry hauteur; “so particular, indeed, that, if Reggie
were willing I should go out with you, I should decline
the doubtful honor!”</p>

<p>“You are very severe, my dear,” said Lady Teignmouth
uneasily; “and yet, I ought not to be annoyed with
you, since, in the eyes of the world, I have certainly the
best of it!”</p>

<p>“You would be sure to take care of that! But,
really, Pauline, you are forgetting that you are a ‘model
of discretion,’ nowadays.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, is it prudent to be seen walking with me? If
we were to meet any one we knew——”</p>

<p>“But I told you the whole affair had blown over. We
should not have returned to England if it had not been
for that.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn turned upon her almost fiercely:</p>

<p>“Then cross the Channel, both of you, as quickly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
you can, for you have urged me so far between you that
now I don’t care what I do, and I mean to be happy
my own way for a few months, even if the whole world
follows your and Reggie’s example, and hunts me down
afterward. Do you understand? Reggie has cast me
off at your bidding, therefore I feel independent of you
all.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t do anything dreadful, Gwen?” pleaded
Lady Teignmouth. “I am sure Reggie will come round
in time, and we shall be comfortable together again.”</p>

<p>“Comfortable together again!” repeated the girl, with
an accent of withering scorn. “Fancy my being comfortable
with you, or staying under your roof! I really
don’t think I am ever likely to fall quite so low as that.”</p>

<p>Lady Teignmouth colored up, and her eyes flashed; but
she dared not show resentment. She was in her sister-in-law’s
power to a certain extent, for if Lady Gwendolyn
chose to insist upon an explanation with Reginald,
and laid the facts of the case clearly before him, it was
doubtful whether she might not convince the earl of her
own innocence and of his wife’s guilt. And then all
her pretty scheming would have been worse than useless,
since it would only aggravate the original offense in
Lord Teignmouth’s eyes.</p>

<p>Consequently Pauline had need to be humble and conciliatory.
Her voice was honey-sweet as she said:</p>

<p>“Of course, that must be as you feel, Gwen; but I
know it would add greatly to my happiness to have the
affair pleasantly settled. I was only saying to Reggie
yesterday that Teignmouth would be unendurable without
you.”</p>

<p>“You are going to Teignmouth, then?”</p>

<p>“For a little while. Reggie has invited a houseful of
people. It will be a dreadful bore having to entertain
them all by myself, and you were always so nice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
popular, dear; but it can’t be helped, of course—it is the
penalty I must pay for my own imprudence.”</p>

<p>“And deceit,” interposed Lady Gwendolyn sternly.</p>

<p>“One was the natural consequence of the other; if
I had not been imprudent I should not have had anything
to conceal. I am quite aware of my own faults,
and really sorry for them; but it would be a dreadful
thing to break up Reggie’s house. And then the scandal
and misery to him, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“I am glad you can feel for him—at last,” retorted
Lady Gwendolyn. “I presume that my troubles are of
no consequence, although they were brought about entirely
by your sin.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do more than express my penitence and regret,”
answered Lady Teignmouth rather sulkily.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is too late for anything else now,”
admitted Lady Gwendolyn contemptuously. “Fortunately,
however, I am learning to do without you both.
If any harm comes to me, it is a comfort to know that the
sin will be at your door.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but no harm will come to you, Gwen, of course.
You will marry happily——”</p>

<p>“And then I shall be off your mind, sha’n’t I? But,
really, I am wasting my time awfully,” she added abruptly.
And, hailing a passing cab, she jumped into it, and,
with a careless nod to Pauline, she drew her veil over
her face, and leaned back out of sight.</p>

<p>After all, perhaps, although Lady Teignmouth had the
best of it in some ways, she might not have been sorry
to change with Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>When her cab stopped at the Langham, Lady Gwendolyn
got out, and walked up and down for awhile, afraid
to enter.</p>

<p>For she had promised to go to Colonel Dacre’s room
directly she returned, and she knew that the keen eyes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
love would immediately find out her trouble. She could
not have borne the most tender questioning just then,
and so she lingered until her face was composed, and she
could trust her voice and eyes.</p>

<p>Then she went slowly up-stairs, and knocked at Colonel
Dacre’s door.</p>

<p>He had left his sick-chamber for the first time, and
was reclining on a couch in a pleasant little sitting-room,
which Lady Gwendolyn had filled with fresh roses in the
morning, that he might receive a fragrant greeting on
entering. He looked up languidly as she opened the
door; but his hollow eyes brightened at once when he saw
who it was, and he held out his thin hand with a smile.</p>

<p>“How long you have been gone, Gwen?”</p>

<p>And he patted the chair near him by way of inviting
her to occupy it.</p>

<p>“Are you tired, dear?” he added suddenly, discovering
that she was very pale.</p>

<p>“No—that is to say, a little. How do you feel,
Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Delightfully frisky! as if I could jump over the
moon. Do you know, I shall be able to travel next
week.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn shook her head.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind; don’t talk nonsense, Colonel
Dacre. Doctor May says you must not stir for a fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Of course; because he wants to keep me under his
thumb as long as he can. Doctor May is a capital fellow;
but he must take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“And of you.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I polished off nearly a whole grouse for my
dinner just now, and I have walked several times across
the room. I don’t mind being an invalid for three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
four days longer, but after that I mean to take the law
into my own hands.”</p>

<p>“Why are you in such a dreadful hurry to leave us?”
she asked, with some faint signs of pique.</p>

<p>“I am not going to leave you, Gwen. I am going to
take you with me wherever I go for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>She colored up, and looked at him in a timid, frightened
sort of way. He put his hand gently over hers.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think you did not wish this,
Gwen. But, whether or no, it must be now.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>He kissed her hand almost reverentially before he answered:</p>

<p>“This is a cruelly scandalous world. Do you think I
should have allowed you to nurse and tend me with such
noble devotion unless I had looked upon you as my future
wife?”</p>

<p>“I did no harm, surely.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, you did an immense deal of good—to
me. Only finish your work by giving me the dear
right to protect and defend you against the whole world.”</p>

<p>“Shall I need a defender?” she asked, lowering her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I hope not; but I flatter myself you will need me,
anyhow. Haven’t you discovered how well we suit each
other, Gwen?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But, oh! Lawrence, tell me truth, I beseech
you—and I will trust you altogether now—is there
anything that should or ought to prevent our marriage?”</p>

<p>“Before Heaven, no!” he answered emphatically.</p>

<p>“I must believe you, in spite of my eyes and my reason,
in spite of my conscience, for I have only one hope
in the world, one thought.”</p>

<p>Then she slipped off her seat, hid her head on his
breast, and added, in a shrinking whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“If what you told me just now is an untruth, I forbid
you to undeceive me ever! You hear? My life is
locked up in yours from henceforth; and if the day
should come,” she added, more faintly still, “that we
ought to part, why, then Heaven will be merciful, perhaps,
and let us both die instead.”</p>

<p>And then she writhed, white and shivering, out of his
arms.</p>

<p>“Oh! Lawrence, I am afraid!”</p>

<p>“Afraid of what, my love?” he asked tenderly, enfolding
her once more, and kissing her lips with all a
lover’s fire.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shall not be allowed to be happy together
long; something will part us.”</p>

<p>“Only death, now, my dearest,” he answered back firmly.
“Only death!”</p>

<p class="center">WHAT HOPE CAN DO.</p>


<p>“Don’t talk to me of tonics!” said Colonel Dacre, a
week after his engagement to Lady Gwendolyn. “I don’t
believe in them at all. There is a sovereign remedy for
‘all the ills that flesh is heir to’; but it does not come
within the doctors’ province, although they take the credit
of its cures.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” inquired Lady Gwendolyn, smiling.</p>

<p>“Hope! When I roused from my long stupor that
night, and looked straight into your dear eyes, the love
and pity there gave me courage to live. Without that
I should have fast drifted back into the shadow again,
and not tried to struggle against my terrible weakness.
But you forget, Gwen, that you have never told me how
you heard of my illness.”</p>

<p>“One of the chambermaids was my first informant.
She said there was a gentleman ill in the hotel; and
when I questioned her, she described you so accurately
that I knew at once whom it must be.”</p>

<p>“But where were you then?”</p>

<p>“Here,” answered Lady Gwendolyn, laughing.</p>

<p>“What! in the hotel? But I thought you wrote me
that you had left.”</p>

<p>“I did leave for a few hours—just long enough to get
my hair dyed golden, and to put myself in deep mourning,
when I returned as ‘Miss Mordaunt.’”</p>

<p>“I wonder you weren’t recognized by the servants.”</p>

<p>“None of them had seen me at all plainly. I was
very anxious they should not, after my encounter with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Mrs. O’Hara, as I did not know what she might say, and
so I took my precautions. Besides, the golden hair does
alter one a good deal.”</p>

<p>“I knew you at once, Gwen.”</p>

<p>“You looked into my eyes first.”</p>

<p>“Wherever my first glance had fallen it would have
been the same thing, Gwen. Indeed, if I had put out
my hand in the darkness and touched you, some subtle
sense would have told me who it was.”</p>

<p>quoted Lady Gwendolyn gaily. “I suppose that is the
kind of warning you would have found at your fingers’
ends, Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“I have done with warnings,” he answered more
gravely. “They may be a help to you when you don’t
want to do a thing; but when you do want they only
make you wish for it more. The best way is to follow
your inclinations, so long as they are sufficiently moral,
and let the rest take care of itself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about being the best way; but it is
the most pleasant. What is the use of living, if one has
to do nothing but struggle,” said Lady Gwendolyn, who
found drifting with the tide a happier state of things
than struggling against circumstances.</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence, and then Colonel Dacre
looked up from the carpet, which he had been studying
with great apparent interest, and observed:</p>

<p>“To-day is Wednesday, is it not?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“How long does it take to buy a dress, Gwen?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon the buyer. If you are fond of
shopping it takes several hours; if you dislike shopping
as much as I do it only takes a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“A few minutes! Come, that is delightful!” he said
cheerily. “But, then, it has to be made, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well, as a rule.”</p>

<p>“You are quizzing me, Gwen, I perceive. We always
expose ourselves to ridicule when we ask for information.”</p>

<p>“Of course, because you display your ignorance so conspicuously.
But tell me what makes you take an interest
in these feminine matters, Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“I was calculating that we might easily be married
on Tuesday, my love.”</p>

<p>“Really, Lawrence!” she exclaimed, blushing furiously.
“I thought you had more common sense.”</p>

<p>“Well, but what need prevent it?”</p>

<p>“A hundred things.”</p>

<p>“Mention one or two.”</p>

<p>“I am not ready, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“You mean as far as clothes go? That is of no consequence,
as you can buy whatever you want afterward.
You will naturally wish to consult my taste, and, therefore,
it will be very convenient to have me on the spot
to appeal to at every moment.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see your face of disgust under the
infliction,” she said, laughing nervously.</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome to the spectacle. But go on
with your reasons, Gwen; we have only had one so far,
and you have still ninety-nine in reserve.”</p>

<p>“It would look so odd.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, when you consider how many people
do get married, such an ordinary case as ours would not
look odd, I assure you. Besides, I thought we had both
decided not to mind what people said. Not that people
will say anything that need afflict you. Lady Teignmouth
is known to be an impracticable person, and very jealous
of your beauty; so that when it is reported that neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
she nor your brother was present at your wedding, it
will be laid to her. Lord Teignmouth and I were always
excellent friends; and though I am not a very grand
person, still, I do not think he would be supposed to object
to the marriage.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. How could he?” said Lady Gwendolyn
quickly. “I never dreamed they would find any
objection of that sort.”</p>

<p>“What, then?”</p>

<p>“I suppose they must accuse me of having behaved
badly in some way to account for Reggie’s desertion.”</p>

<p>“Not at all; they will think it is one of my lady’s
caprices. She is cordially disliked by her own sex, because
she has a way of making herself so extremely
agreeable to their husbands.”</p>

<p>“Like your friend, Mrs. O’Hara,” put in Lady Gwendolyn
maliciously.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the two women can be compared in any
way. Norah is a thoughtless flirt—Lady Teignmouth is
a cold-blooded coquette.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a distinction without a difference, Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think so, Gwen, since a certain
young lady, who is beyond measure dear to my heart,
was certainly a thoughtless flirt in days not very long
gone by.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean any harm,” said Gwendolyn, coloring.</p>

<p>“Exactly; nor did Nora. But Lady Teignmouth
means a good deal of harm. She has the most insatiable
vanity of any woman I ever knew, and would quite have
enjoyed that affair at Turoy as a tribute to her charms,
if only it could have been proved that Mr. Belmont committed
suicide in despair.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then, you are convinced at last that Mr. Belmont
was Lady Teignmouth’s lover, and not mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly; for ‘putting that an’ that thegither,’ as the
Scotch say, I see the whole case clear before me. Lady
Teignmouth meant to make a fool of me—not because I
was particularly desirable, but because she looked upon
all men as her legitimate prey. When she found that
you had saved her the trouble she felt very spiteful, and
longed to make a breach between us. I am convinced
now that the person I saw at Preston Station was Lady
Teignmouth, although she did get into a third-class carriage,
and assumed a regular Northern burr on purpose
to divert my suspicions. She kept me to luncheon after
she had given me your address, because she did not want
me to reach Turoy until she was ready to receive me.”</p>

<p>“But I should have fancied you would have been in
her way there.”</p>

<p>“No; because she wanted to kill two birds with one
stone—get rid of a lover whose ardor was growing
troublesome and compromising, and disenchant me. I
must say that she is a consummate actress, and managed
things very cleverly.”</p>

<p>“Too cleverly, I think,” answered Lady Gwendolyn.</p>

<p>“But you will admit, dearest, that if you go in for
that sort of thing you may as well do it nicely.”</p>

<p>“In fact, if you are a rogue at all, you may as well
be——”</p>

<p>“A good rogue,” put in Colonel Dacre, laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t like your morality at all, Lawrence; it is
much better to fail in a bad trade.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; but, then, I did not know we were speaking
morally. I was discussing the question from a
worldly point of view. But go on with your reasons
against our speedy marriage—there are still ninety eight
to account for.”</p>

<p>“I—I—think I am afraid of you, Lawrence,” answered
Lady Gwendolyn, looking down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Go on; that’s a reason with a reason, and, therefore,
needs explaining.”</p>

<p>“I can’t explain it. I know I oughtn’t to be; and that
you are one of those men who may be trusted; that I
shall still keep your affection even when my beauty is
waning. Still, when I picture the long future that may
be before us, I get frightened.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not love me, Gwen. When I remember
that we may have a long future I thrill with joy—because
we shall be together always—unless death should
part us. This is just what I have prayed and longed
for, and I found myself getting terribly depressed the
other day because I was twelve years older than you, and
might have to leave you a little while alone in the world.”</p>

<p>His accent and expression showed such deep sincerity,
such a passion of yearning love, that, although Lady
Gwendolyn was rather chary of her caresses as a rule,
thinking she had already made too many concessions,
she bent down now, and laid her fresh, cool cheek against
his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t, darling,” he said diffidently. “You pain me.”</p>

<p>“Why not let me be a little humble, Lawrence? Balzac
says that you can never be sure you have really won a
woman’s love until she is on her knees before you.”</p>

<p>“I think I could bear to see you there if it had such a
meaning.”</p>

<p>She slipped down, blushing, and looked up at him
with such a divine smile, such true love-light in her eyes,
that he would have been less than human if he had not
strained her to his heart, while he murmured again and
again that he loved her better than life, next to honor,
and after God.</p>

<p>Still, when he released her, he said, with comical persistence:</p>

<p>“Now for the ninety-seventh, Gwen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“I am tired of giving you reasons, you dispose of them
so summarily.”</p>

<p>“Because they are so flimsy, and unsubstantial. And,
seriously, darling, it is right we should be married at
once. You stand quite alone—you are beautiful enough
to make other women your enemies by simply unveiling
your face. And you will surely be very lonely in lodgings.”</p>

<p>“Am I to go into lodgings, then?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say you ought. There can be no
excuse for your remaining here, now that I am so much
stronger.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn looked exceedingly grave.</p>

<p>“It seems very difficult to be single comfortably,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, there the world is good enough to help us poor
lovers. Some of you would hesitate half your life away
if you did not occasionally feel the need of masculine aid
and intervention.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were strong-minded, then.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, you are not! Only in that case I
should not be pleading to you now, as there is nothing
earthly of which I have a greater horror than a woman
who raves about her rights, and lectures publicly on things
she does not half understand.”</p>

<p>“When I lecture I’ll get you to coach me beforehand,”
said Lady Gwendolyn saucily. “Of course I should not
like to be deprived of my rights any more than the rest.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what they are?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do. Let me see, I have a right to your
entire affection.”</p>

<p>“Granted. What next?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a long time, and then laughed out gaily.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know. I expect if I had your entire
affection there would not be any need to make any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
minor claims, unless it were for increased pin-money;
and you have such ridiculous notions upon that subject
I am only afraid of being too rich.”</p>

<p>“Then we have settled that question. How about the
other?”</p>

<p>“What other?” she asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, child. You seem to take a pleasure
in tormenting me.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn hung down her head, and became as
red as a rose. She understood now.</p>

<p>“But I really don’t think there is any such great
hurry, Lawrence,” she said, still disposed to capitulate.</p>

<p>“And I really think I have sufficiently proved that there
is something to hurry about,” was the cool reply.</p>

<p>Her arguments failing to convince, Lady Gwendolyn
took refuge in a pout. This is a woman’s last refuge
when she finds her position is weak, and is a sure index
of faltering resolution.</p>

<p>“You are very unreasonable, Lawrence, and abominably
arbitrary. Because you want a thing it must needs
be done.”</p>

<p>“If the thing be right.”</p>

<p>“But your wishing it seems to make it right, in your
own eyes,” she answered petulantly.</p>

<p>“You are entirely mistaken there, Gwen. I love you
so tenderly that if I wished anything that would harm
you in your reputation, your self-respect, in any way, in
fact, I would bite my tongue in twain before I would
advocate it by a single word. But you ought to marry
before people find out that you have been here with me.
Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“I thought nothing could be said, as this is a hotel——”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that does not aggravate the case, by
rendering it more conspicuous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“You turn and twist every argument I bring forward
so as to make it serve your cause,” she said resentfully.
“It is no use my trying to have an opinion of my own.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I am trying to persuade you,
Gwen,” he said, drawing her to him in spite of her struggles.
“You shall have your own way as much as is
good for you after we are married; but now I want
mine. Don’t be so impracticable, darling,” he added,
in his coaxing voice. “You know what I demand is ‘just,
expedient, and right.’”</p>

<p>“I know it is very tiresome to be hurried,” she said,
by way of showing that she had still a few objections
in reserve.</p>

<p>“But you sha’n’t be hurried, dearest. Listen to my
program. This evening you will go to Mrs. Venable, in
Park Lane.”</p>

<p>“How do you know she will receive me?”</p>

<p>“I have already asked her the question, and received
a satisfactory reply,” said Colonel Dacre quietly. “I
never let the grass grow under my feet when I have
work to do that should be done quickly.”</p>

<p>“But what made you think of Mrs. Venable?”</p>

<p>“For two or three reasons. As your former governess
I thought she would be a suitable person. And then I
knew you liked her, and would prefer to be married
from her house.”</p>

<p>“Then I should have to stay there a fortnight,” said
Lady Gwendolyn, with a little air of triumph, for she
thought she was going to demolish the gallant colonel’s
program.</p>

<p>“Not at all. There is nothing to prevent our being
married to-morrow, if you like.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were obliged to remain a certain time
in a place.”</p>

<p>“I have a special license, Gwen, and, moreover, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
have both been more than the required length of time in
this parish.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said rather dubiously. “You have arranged
everything, then?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Would you mind trying on your wedding-ring,
to make sure it fits?”</p>

<p>Gwendolyn’s eyes flashed, and her color rose. But
when he stooped down and kissed her, she suddenly laid
her hand on his breast and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I begin to think you don’t love me a bit, Gwen,” he
said, caressing her tenderly; “or that you look upon
me as a kind of ogre, who is not to be trusted with a
woman’s happiness.”</p>

<p>“You know it isn’t that.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it?”</p>

<p>“Marriage is a great change, and a great risk,” she
stammered out at last.</p>

<p>“Of course it is a change, dear love; but it cannot be
any risk when you have a man of honor to deal with,
and know yourself to be truly valued and beloved.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said desperately; “but I am afraid I shall
often trouble about that lady I saw at Borton Hall.”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre changed color visibly.</p>

<p>“I thought you had promised me never to think about
or mention her again, Gwen? I do solemnly swear over
again that no woman living, excepting yourself, can
ever say that I have asked her to be my wife. I had a
good many foolish fancies as a lad, but none of them
went as far as that.”</p>

<p>“Was she one of your foolish fancies?” inquired Lady
Gwendolyn hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whom you mean by she, but I can answer
for it that my ‘foolish fancies’ are all married, and
the mothers of families by this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“Then you haven’t had any lately?” she asked, with
timid but anxious earnestness.</p>

<p>“Not for the last ten years, on my word.”</p>

<p>“And the lady at Borton——” she persisted.</p>

<p>“Was a myth, or an impostor, and need not trouble
you for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said she was probably a madwoman
who had delusions?” observed Lady Gwendolyn, who
appeared to have stored up carefully the lightest word
her lover had spoken on the subject.</p>

<p>“Did I say that?” he returned, slightly embarrassed.
“Well, it may be so; and all the better if it were, as she
would not be likely to trouble you again.”</p>

<p>“Will she now, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, my love; I’ll take care about that, when once
you are in my charge. Besides, you may be sure that
if she is not right in her mind, she has been put under
confinement by this time.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped so, because—don’t be angry with
me, Lawrence—but if she were to claim you after we
were married, I should not feel that I ought to stay
with you a minute longer.”</p>

<p>“Then the ravings of a maniac would drive you out
of your home, even after we had been all in all to each
other; and you ought to have learned to trust me.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it would. To take another woman’s
place would be such a terrible wrong. Indeed, I don’t
think I ought to marry you at all, only—only I am so
wicked, so horrible. I would rather be your wife a little
while than never at all. And you swear that you are
free?”</p>

<p>“I swear it!” he answered solemnly and firmly.</p>

<p>“Then I won’t trouble about all these horrors any
more. After all, any man might be married secretly—who
is to know? And you always must trust to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
word, mustn’t you? If I had never seen that woman
at Borton Hall, it would not have occurred to me to ask
the question. I should have made so sure it was all
right.”</p>

<p>“And it is all right now, you foolish child. Do I
look like a malefactor and a scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“No; you look very nice,” Lady Gwendolyn admitted,
with a blush.</p>

<p>“But not nice enough to be trusted, it seems. However,
I’ll teach you that later, my love; <i>en attendant</i>, you
may as well fix our wedding-day.”</p>

<p>“This day three months,” said Lady Gwendolyn demurely;
“unless you think that too soon.”</p>

<p>“You little witch! If you don’t take care I will insist
upon its taking place in three days!” retorted Colonel
Dacre.</p>

<p>“But I am not obliged to obey.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I shall use coercive measures. But seriously,
very seriously, Gwen, you are paining me by all these
objections. If you don’t love me, leave me. Heaven
knows I do not want an unwilling wife; but if you pretend
to care for me, act up to your profession. I have
put you to the test, and if you fail me, I shall get away
out of the country as fast as I can, and try and forget
the woman who has spoiled my whole life. I have made
all my arrangements to leave England on Wednesday.
Will you come with me or not? I warn you fairly that
I am not poor spirited enough ever to give you another
chance of fooling me. If once I leave you behind, we
shall never meet again on this side of the grave.”</p>

<p>His decided tone startled Gwendolyn. She saw she
had found a lover at last who would not be played
fast and loose with, and she began to respect Colonel
Dacre as much as she had loved him.</p>

<p>To have parted with him forever would have broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
her heart outright, and as she could only keep him one
way, she must make the sacrifice he demanded.</p>

<p>To do Lady Gwendolyn justice, she was not wont to
give grudgingly when she did give. So that having decided
to accord what he asked, she made the gift sweeter
by the grace with which she gave. All his long life
Colonel Dacre would remember the smile that lighted
up her blushing face as she put her hand into his, and
murmured:</p>

<p>“I will marry you when you like, Lawrence, and trust
you whatever betide.”</p>

<p>If Lady Gwendolyn had kept the second promise as
she kept the first, how much sorrow it would have saved
them both.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A HAPPY BRIDE.</p>


<p>Mrs. Venable was a very kind, motherly woman, but
there was one inconvenience—in sojourning with a person
who knew her antecedents so well—her visitor
found.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre had just hinted at some misunderstanding
between Lord Teignmouth and Lady Gwendolyn, and
allowed Mrs. Venable to lay it all to the countess; but,
of course, knowing how much attached the brother and
sister had once been, Mrs. Venable did feel a little
curious as to the cause of their breach, and tried hard
to find it out without actually putting the question.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn got out of the traps laid for her gallantly,
but she began to think Mrs. Venable was playing
into her lover’s hand. She would not have put off her
wedding-day now on any account.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre was fully occupied in the intervening
days. He had to run down to Borton Hall to attend to
some last arrangements there, and this day seemed so
terribly long to Lady Gwendolyn that it was quite a
revelation to her. It was wonderful happiness to remember
that soon they never need be parted, and she
would belong altogether to him.</p>

<p>The wedding was to be a very quiet one. Under the
circumstances this was very desirable, and, fortunately,
it chimed in with the tastes and feelings of both the
fiancés.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was to have two bridesmaids—for
form’s sake—one, the Honorable Beatrice Ponsonby, a
tried and true friend, of whom Colonel Dacre approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
cordially; and the other, Mrs. Venable’s daughter, a
pretty child of six years old. The ceremony was to take
place at ten o’clock. After that they were to breakfast
quietly in Park Lane, then catch the one-o’clock train for
Dover, and cross over to Calais at night.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre had made arrangements to remain
abroad until the spring, and then they would return
home, and, after spending about a month in town, take
up their residence at Borton Hall. This was the program
they had drawn up between them, and, unless anything
unforeseen should occur to disturb it, it promised
exceedingly well.</p>

<p>There was no reason why they should keep away from
Borton. Lady Gwendolyn was not ashamed to face her
brother or his wife, and Colonel Dacre looked forward
to vindicating his darling, and claiming for her the respect
and homage that were her due.</p>

<p>If Lady Teignmouth had dared to traduce her—let
her beware. He was not bound to spare Reginald, although
they had once been friends. His wife’s honor
would always be far dearer to him than aught else besides.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening Colonel Dacre dined in Park
Lane, and was gratified to find that Mrs. Venable had
the tact to leave the drawing-room for them after dessert.</p>

<p>“My husband likes to have me while he is smoking
his cigar, as he is away all day,” was the apology she
made, as she took her departure, and the lovers could
not help laughing happily in each other’s faces, it seemed
so very unnecessary.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre possessed himself of half Lady Gwendolyn’s
couch, and did not seem to notice that it was a
tight fit for two.</p>

<p>“Well, my darling,” he said, as he drew her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
down on to his breast; “you don’t ask me if everything
is ready.”</p>

<p>“With a person of your promptitude and energy such
a question is superfluous,” she returned, smiling up at
him from the safe shelter which would be hers by divine
right on the morrow.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are dreadfully miserable?” he said
softly.</p>

<p>“Dreadfully,” she answered, longing to torment him a
little, and yet feeling as if she could not. “How do I
look?”</p>

<p>“More beautiful than ever,” he answered rapturously.</p>

<p>“Surely my eyes are red with crying.”</p>

<p>He bent down so anxiously to examine them, that she
laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goose!” she added sweetly. “I wouldn’t
marry you if they were.”</p>

<p>“You are such a will-o’-the-wisp, Gwen. I sha’n’t feel
safe until eleven o’clock to-morrow, and so I tell you
fairly.”</p>

<p>“But you are not obliged to be safe then,” she retorted
saucily. “Wives do run away from their husbands
occasionally.”</p>

<p>“If you ever should, as you value your life, go alone,”
he answered, with sudden fierceness; and then he cooled
down as quickly, and said he had not forgotten her old
tricks, “there was nothing she loved better than to tease.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but what did you mean about my going alone?”
she asked, so simply that he felt ashamed to have doubted
this innocent child, even for a moment, and hastened
to change the subject by speaking of his arrangements
for her comfort on the morrow.</p>

<p>“Now, Lawrence,” she said at last, “I am not going
to be carried about like a piece of rare china, in cotton
wool. I am not the least delicate, and I should enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
roughing it beyond measure, on your arm. Do let us
travel sensibly, and mix with people as we go along. I
want variety—even adventure—and I mean to dine at
the tables d’hôte, instead of in solitary state in our own
salon.”</p>

<p>“Under those circumstances you are likely to have
the kind of adventure you will hardly care for,” he
answered gravely.</p>

<p>“Not under your protection? With that big mustache
of yours you look quite terrible, I assure you; and
I often think I should be dreadfully afraid of you if I
cared for you less.”</p>

<p>“And yet ‘perfect love casteth out fear,’ Gwen.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; I am not afraid of you now, excepting so
far as is proper and expedient under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>He looked a little hurt.</p>

<p>“It can’t be proper and expedient in the slightest degree
under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean I should be afraid to flirt.”</p>

<p>“Surely you would find a better reason than that for
refraining.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, you are so severely literal, Lawrence!”</p>

<p>“‘I must speak by the card or equivocation will undo
me,’ as Shakespeare says somewhere.”</p>

<p>And then she pulled down his head, and whispered in
his ear so softly:</p>

<p>“You dear old goose! Haven’t you found out yet
that I love you?”</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre’s answer is not worth recording; but
it was very expressive and impressive, for Lady Gwendolyn
looked very red after it, and was not sorry to
hide her confusion on his breast, though, perhaps, she
was hardly woman enough yet to understand the mighty
absorbing passion she had inspired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>At ten o’clock precisely Colonel Dacre loosened his
hold on her and said gently:</p>

<p>“Now, my darling, you must go to bed. To-morrow
will be a fatiguing day for you, and I shall want to see
a few roses at starting. Oh! Gwen, when I think what
to-morrow is to be, it seems to me that I must be dreaming.
All my own—my very own, ‘to love and to cherish
till death us do part.’ It is too much happiness! Give
me one kiss—the first I have ever had from you, sweetest—to
make it all seem real.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered shyly, and trembling; “I have
always vowed that my husband should have my first
kiss.”</p>

<p>“Then I am to wait till to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you, my dear life!” he murmured;
then kissed both the hands she extended to him, and hurried
off.</p>

<p>It seemed a dreadful parting to him, and yet it was
only for twelve hours.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn could hardly realize that she was
going to be married when she woke in the morning. But
when her new maid appeared, her head just visible under
an avalanche of white drapery, she began to think it
was probable, and that she had better get up at once, and
adorn herself to please her master’s eye.</p>

<p>Her master!</p>

<p>Proud as she was, naturally, the term did not humiliate
her in connection with Lawrence. Let a woman
be ever so haughty, she is ready to be the slave of the
man she loves.</p>

<p>Miss Ponsonby arrived in time to arrange the wreath
and veil, and was so charmed with the effect that she
said, with honest admiration:</p>

<p>“It is a shame of you to have such a quiet wedding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Gwendolyn. I should like all London to see and approve.”</p>

<p>“And I am so altered,” answered the bride, with a
tender blush and smile, “that I don’t care for any one’s
admiration now except Lawrence’s.”</p>

<p>“You are civil, my dear, certainly,” laughed the Honorable
Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t mean you, of course, dear. I am glad
of your approval; but, then, I always make sure of
that.”</p>

<p>“And of somebody else’s, too, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn put her arms round her friend’s neck
with the impulsiveness that is always so attractive.</p>

<p>“Beatrice,” she said, with tears of happiness trembling
on her black lashes, “I love Lawrence with all my heart,
and I would rather be his wife than queen of twenty
kingdoms!”</p>

<p>Then she glanced at the clock, and, seeing it wanted
only a quarter to ten, began to mold on her gloves.</p>

<p>The carriage drove up just as she had finished, and,
taking her bouquet from the maid, she went down-stairs
with the sun shining full on her as she went, and yet
unable to find a flaw in her beauty or a shadow in her
happy eyes.</p>

<p>Colonel Dacre and his best man were standing at the
altar as Lady Gwendolyn entered the church on the arm
of Lord Denby, Miss Ponsonby’s father, and a very old
friend of the St. Maur family. A lovely light and color
went over her face as she saw him, and met the glance
of loving admiration that welcomed her to his side.</p>

<p>Then she forgot to realize herself as she stood by the
steady figure, and listened to the words of the marriage
service. She began to understand what a terrible chain
matrimony must be when people joined hands without
joining hearts; and a thrill of thankfulness ran through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
her, remembering what perfect union subsisted between
herself and her husband.</p>

<p>For he was her husband now. The priest had joined
their hands, and had lifted his voice to say: “Those
whom God has joined let no man put asunder.”</p>

<p>The warm, firm pressure of Lawrence’s fingers
seemed to testify that he was well able to keep what he
had won, and the consciousness of his strength soothed
and comforted Lady Gwendolyn as nothing else could
have done.</p>

<p>She liked his gravity, too, for it showed how thoroughly
he felt with her, and realized the deeper and
holier meaning of their marriage. There was quite a
gathering in the church by the time the ceremony was
over; but neither bride nor bridegroom knew much about
it. Lady Gwendolyn signed her maiden name for the
last time, and then they stepped out into the sunshine together.</p>

<p>Happy, beautiful, and young, the world seemed a
lovely place to these two; and they felt as if they had
one smile, as well as one heart, between them, as each
looked into the other’s eyes, and saw reflected there
the happiness of his and her heart.</p>

<p>There was not much time to spare when they got back
to Park Lane; but Lord Denby made a pretty little
speech during the breakfast, which sounded as if it had
been inspired by Veuve Clicquot’s best champagne, as it
was so frothily graceful; then Colonel Dacre looked at
the clock and touched his wife’s arm.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shall miss our train, Gwen, if we
don’t start soon.”</p>

<p>She rose directly, and in a very short time returned
in a traveling-dress, which was of brown cashmere,
trimmed with silk of a darker shade.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was not one of those brides who like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
to advertise themselves. To steal quietly through the
crowd, unrecognized and unobserved, was all she asked;
and she knew her husband’s refined tastes would be
offended, as well as her own, by any display. But that
he approved of the brown cashmere, and the quiet, but
elegant, little hat of the same color, was evident from his
eyes as he took a survey of her dainty figure ere he
handed her into the carriage.</p>

<p>On their way to the station Colonel Dacre held his
wife’s hand; but he did not attempt any further demonstration,
and she was thankful for the self-denial, which
gave her time to recover a little from the confusion of her
position.</p>

<p>But once in the coupé he had engaged, and on their
way to Dover, all his pent-up passion seemed to break
forth, and he crushed her against his breast as he murmured:</p>

<p>“Now for my kiss—the one you have kept back for
your happy husband, love.”</p>

<p>And as she shyly approached her lips to his it seemed
to both as if their very souls mingled in that long, glad,
passionate embrace.</p>

<p class="center">THE FIRST CLOUD.</p>


<p>“I declare, we have been six months abroad, and not
yet come across a single person we know,” said Lady
Gwendolyn to her husband one morning. “I wonder how
it is?”</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t tried to come across people we
know, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“But it might easily have happened accidentally.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let us boast,” Colonel Dacre returned, as he
passed his hand through her arm. “A thing always
happens directly you begin to congratulate yourself upon
having escaped it.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t say another word.”</p>

<p>“Come for a walk instead,” he said. “You have
spoiled me so, Gwen, that I can’t enjoy my cigar unless
you are hanging about me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Lawrence, I am sure I never hang about you.”</p>

<p>“What do you do, then?”</p>

<p>“I walk by your side.”</p>

<p>“Like a discreet British maiden. Do you know you
have got your part very perfect, considering the short
time you have had to learn it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t call six months a short time.”</p>

<p>“It has seemed so to me—perhaps, because I have
been so happy. I am afraid you have been dreadfully
bored, Gwen, as it has passed so slowly.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Lawrence!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear love, you forced me reluctantly to draw
that inference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn pouted, and Colonel Dacre, being
still his wife’s lover, as men of his constant nature continue
to be all their lives, stooped his tall head and
kissed the sweet, red mouth.</p>

<p>“Now, put on your hat,” he said, “and we will go
for a little stroll. I am quite beginning to like this free-and-easy
sort of life, Gwen. Are not you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to mind much where we are so that
we are together. I have given up the world and its
vanities——”</p>

<p>“All for love?”</p>

<p>“All for love,” she repeated. “I couldn’t have a better
reason, surely.”</p>

<p>“I am quite satisfied with it, if that is what you
mean. But be quick and dress, or the beauty of the
day will be over; and, mind you, wrap up well.”</p>

<p>She came back presently in velvet and furs, with a
pretty, frosty bloom on her round cheeks; and as Colonel
Dacre offered her his arm, he said proudly to himself
that there wasn’t a woman in France who could come
up to his darling. And his darling was quite aware that
she was looking her best, and thoroughly enjoyed the
respectful admiration she excited, not for its own sake,
but because she liked Lawrence to feel that she was appreciated.</p>

<p>They walked up the center avenue of the Tuileries,
and then made their way down the Rue Royale to the
boulevards, which looked very gay this bright morning.</p>

<p>Then, walking briskly back again, they paid a visit to
the pastry-cook at the corner of the Rue Castiglione, and
lunched off oyster patties and babas, finishing up with the
tiniest glass of curaçoa, as a suitable defense against the
cold.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was arranging her veil after this
moderate but dainty refection, when a very magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
dame rustled into the shop, and said, in abominable
French, which, however, she seemed delighted to air:</p>

<p>“<i>Donnez moi oon patty, mademoiselle, et dépêche parceque
je suis en hâte.</i>”</p>

<p>This pastry-cook being much affected by the English,
mademoiselle was accustomed to this sort of thing, and
did not even smile as she handed madame her pâté out
of the hot safe in the center of the shop, and placed a
chair for her beside one of the little marble tables.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn glanced furtively at the face belonging
to this voice, and then made her way toward the
door, keeping as far as possible from the neighborhood of
the newcomer, so as not to attract her attention.</p>

<p>But Colonel Dacre, who had noticed nothing, turned
round from examining some bonbons in the window, and,
seeing her close to the door, called out:</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Gwen, I haven’t paid.”</p>

<p>The lady at the marble table looked up then, and by
simply catching Colonel Dacre’s eye, explained Lady
Gwendolyn’s little ruse.</p>

<p>“What, you, Norah?” he said, with evident pleasure,
as he extended his hand. “What brought you to Paris?”</p>

<p>“Well, money; but I forget how much,” she answered,
with her old vivacity, although he thought her much
thinner and paler than when they met last. “I am getting
so tired of England, of everybody, and everything.
Is that your wife who has just left the shop so precipitately?”
she concluded, with some abruptness.</p>

<p>“She has just gone out, certainly.”</p>

<p>“To avoid me? You need not deny it, Lawrence, it is
very natural she should. However, I have something
she ought, in justice, to see. Will you tell me where
you are staying?”</p>

<p>“At the Hotel d’Albion, close by. If you will tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
where you are, Norah, I will call upon you to-morrow,
and take charge of anything you may have for her.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, that will be best,” she answered. “Don’t
let me keep you from Lady Gwendolyn. I am at the
Grand Hotel, number forty three; but don’t come before
noon. I sleep so wretchedly nowadays, that I am glad
to rest in the morning. If Lady Gwendolyn minds your
coming, write me a line instead, and I shall understand.
I think if I had a husband I cared for I should be awfully
jealous.”</p>

<p>“Not if he gave you no cause, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But do go. I wouldn’t for the world add
to my offenses in your wife’s eyes by exposing her to
annoyance. She is much too handsome to be a minute
alone in the streets of Paris.”</p>

<p>“True,” he said, and hurried off.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was standing at a book-shop waiting
for him, and put her arm into his without a word.
Neither did he make any remark. He thought it best
not to speak of Mrs. O’Hara, until he had heard what
she had to say on the morrow. Lady Gwendolyn was
unusually grave and quiet for the rest of the day, and
if he happened to raise his eyes suddenly he caught a very
wistful look of the dark eyes; but he bided his time, and
still said nothing.</p>

<p>That night when Lady Gwendolyn fancied that her
husband was asleep she cried softly to herself, for the
string of old, sad memories in her heart had been too
much for her, and she wondered fearfully if this woman
had come to take her husband from her as she had taken
Percy Gray from poor Lady Maria.</p>

<p>“She is tired, poor child!” he said to himself; and,
leaving word with her maid that she was not to rise a moment
earlier than she felt inclined, on his account, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
was going for a walk, he amused himself with a morning
visit to the Palais Royale.</p>

<p>Returning about ten o’clock, he was met at the door
of the salon by Phœbe, who said that her mistress begged
him to excuse her, as she had a tiresome headache, and
would lie down for another hour. This was the first
time Colonel Dacre had been called upon to breakfast
without the fair fresh face of his spouse near him at
table, and an expression of disappointment came into his
gray eyes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he said with admirable self-abnegation:</p>

<p>“Tell your mistress not to get up on any account, if
she feels better in bed. But I suppose I shall be able
to see her before I go out?”</p>

<p>“My lady desired particularly that she might not be
disturbed, sir. She said she thought she should be well
enough to take a drive in the afternoon if she kept quiet
for the next few hours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” answered Colonel Dacre. And he
might have been unreasonable; but somehow he felt
snubbed. “What has her ladyship taken, Phœbe?”</p>

<p>“A strong cup of tea, sir; that was all she would
have.”</p>

<p>And the girl, who was already attached to her young
mistress, looked quite distressed. Colonel Dacre was
obliged to assume a tranquillity he did not feel to reassure
her.</p>

<p>“Rest is sure to do her more good than anything,
Phœbe. Be sure and tell her ladyship when she rings
for you that I was obliged to go out this morning; but
shall hope to see her at luncheon time.”</p>

<p>Phœbe bowed, and left the room. Then Colonel Dacre
swallowed a cup of coffee, ate part of a roll, and then,
telling the waiter to get him a cab, prepared for his visit
to Mrs. O’Hara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>He found his old friend reclining on a sofa in an exquisite
peignoir of pale blue cashmere, trimmed with
lace, while a coquettish little cap rested on the top of her
brown hair. She held out to him her jeweled hand languidly.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you, Lawrence. How is your
wife?”</p>

<p>“She is rather tired this morning.”</p>

<p>“I hope that is all.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too. She is not delicate, naturally, neither
is she very strong, and we have been walking more than
she is accustomed to do since we came to Paris.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?”</p>

<p>“Rather more than a week?”</p>

<p>“You are on your way to England, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I believe so; but we have scarcely decided yet.”</p>

<p>“I presume you would hurry home if anything happened
to your uncle, Sir Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Naturally. But we heard from him just before we
left Biarritz, and he then said that he was remarkably
well, so that I do not anticipate a sudden recall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Hara had a letter in her hand; but she put it
down on the table, and lifted those wonderful Irish eyes
of hers to his face.</p>

<p>“Lawrence,” she said quietly, “will you answer me one
question?”</p>

<p>“Nay, a dozen, if I can, Norah.”</p>

<p>“One will be enough. Has the accusation I made
against Lady Gwendolyn that day at the ‘Langham’ ever
troubled you in the slightest degree?”</p>

<p>He reflected before he answered:</p>

<p>“I don’t think it has. I have such full faith in my wife,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Still, you know me well enough to understand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
I should not make a statement of this sort unless I believed
it to be true.”</p>

<p>“No; but we are all liable to error, Norah.”</p>

<p>“And you may as well add that a person of my impulsive
temper is doubly liable. I certainly did think
that Lady Gwendolyn had been the cause of my poor
brother’s death, and had destroyed him by her cruel
coquetries; and, as I am not in the habit of bridling my
tongue, or disguising my feelings, I told her plainly what
I thought. But since then I have discovered my mistake.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said eagerly.</p>

<p>She pointed to the letter on the table.</p>

<p>“Read that,” she said, “and it will save my breath.
You will see by the signature that it was written by my
poor brother himself, and is dated the second of August.”</p>

<p>“The day before his death?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It is in pencil, as you will perceive, but is
quite legible, and has the ‘Dragon, Turoy, Westmoreland,’
printed in colors on the paper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. The landlord of the ‘Dragon,’ who is
quite the gentleman in his way, must have lent it to him.
I remember that he affected all those little refinements.”</p>

<p>“Very well, now read it through, and tell me what you
make of it.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling me, first of all, to whom this
letter was written?”</p>

<p>“To a Miss Pindar—a relation of my mother’s, who
brought us up when our parents died. Poor George, with
all his faults, was very much attached to her, and always
kept her <i>au courant</i> as to his movements. She was his
favorite of us two, and I know she scraped and saved in
order to send him money for his pleasures. But he did
mean to make it all up to her,” added Mrs. O’Hara. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
saw the letter he wrote to Miss Pindar directly he came
into his property.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Colonel Dacre that promises did not
cost much, but he refrained from any hint to this effect,
seeing how much it comforted Norah to accredit her
brother with good intentions.</p>

<p class="center">LOVED AND LOST.</p>


<p>“Will you read the letter aloud?” added Mrs. O’Hara,
as he was turning it over, and he began at once:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Aunt</span>——” [He always called her “aunt,”
put in Norah, parenthetically.] “A more miserable man
than I does not exist. Lady Teignmouth has thrown me
over, as you warned me that she would when it suited
her purpose; you know how desperately I loved her; you
also know how she has kept me dangling at her skirts
all these years, luring me on to destruction with her
sweet, false eyes. Life is nothing to me without her, and,
though she has sworn so often that she loved me, she
laughed me to scorn when I suggested that she and I
might be happy together in another country. You will
say all this is very wrong, aunt. Pauline is another man’s
wife; but my only excuse is that the first time we met I
believed her to be free, and she did not undeceive me,
although she must have seen that I was badly smitten,
and ready to make a dolt of myself at her bidding. Now
it has gone so far that I could not draw back if I would,
and I would not if I could. You will scarcely understand
such mad infatuation, but I am not the only man
who has preferred to put an end to his existence rather
than live without the woman he loved. I am to meet
Pauline to-night, and with a few words from her lips my
fate will be decided. When this reaches you I may be
beyond the reach of everything but your prayers, but I
know that even if the whole world condemn me, you will
always—always have a kind word, and a kind thought,
for the boy you reared, although he died a guilty, despairing
man.</p>

<p>“Turoy, 2d August, 19—.”</p>
</div>

<p>“You see that the poor, unhappy fellow took his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
life in his despair,” said Norah, wiping her eyes furtively.
“He always spoke to me very admiringly of Lady
Teignmouth, but I had no idea that he cared for her
like that, or I would have saved him, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to make any use of this letter?” inquired
Colonel Dacre quietly.</p>

<p>“No; I have had enough of revenge for the present. If
Lady Teignmouth were to come in my way, I should
probably tax her with her deceit and perfidy, because, you
know, I never can keep things in; but we are not likely
to meet, and meanwhile you may have the letter if you
will promise to take care of it that I may have it for
reference later, if required.”</p>

<p>This Colonel Dacre readily guaranteed, and then he
turned to Mrs. O’Hara, and said:</p>

<p>“And now about yourself, Norah? What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular.”</p>

<p>“I heard you were going to be married to a Russian
prince.”</p>

<p>She colored furiously.</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>“Some fellow we met at Nice, but I can’t for the life
of me remember his name. I wouldn’t believe it, but
Gwen said it was just the sort of thing you would do.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she inquired sharply, keeping her face averted
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, she thought you would not care for a quiet,
humdrum life in England.”</p>

<p>A gleam of fierce scorn came into Norah’s violet eyes,
and then flashed out again, leaving them dim as with
unshed tears.</p>

<p>“Whatever I might have cared for I am not likely to
get.”</p>

<p>Her tone was sad, her face so wistful, Colonel Dacre
forgot her bad accent, and said with earnest sympathy:</p>

<p>“Anyhow, don’t make a mull of your life, Norah, in a
fit of the blues. There is no reason why you shouldn’t be
happy.”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” she replied, with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>“Then it is true about the Russian prince?”</p>

<p>“Come, Lawrence, you have quite enough to do to
attend to your domestic duties!” she retorted gaily. “Go
home and show that letter to your wife—and—don’t meddle
in my affairs. No man can serve two masters, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Still, I think he might serve his friend without being
in the least degree disloyal to his wife.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, I really don’t know—but I fancy the interest
of the two would clash occasionally. However, I am
not going to try the experiment. But your wife will be
wondering what has become of you. Good-by, Lawrence;”
and she held out her hand to him with a softened
air. “I should like you to tell Lady Gwendolyn from me,
if you thought she would care for the confession, that
I am very sorry to have misjudged her.”</p>

<p>“I know she will be pleased to hear that you have found
out your mistake.”</p>

<p>“Then tell her by all means, and good-by once more.”</p>

<p>He kissed her hand affectionately, and was moving toward
the door, when she called him back to say, with a
flash of her old humor:</p>

<p>“A fellow I met at Nice told me that ere long there
might be an heir to Borton Hall. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Tell me about the Russian prince first. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, hanging her head a little.</p>

<p>“So is the other, then.”</p>

<p>She nodded to him benevolently, but there were tears
still in her eyes, and he seemed to see only them as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
turned for one last look at his old friend’s widow ere
she disappeared out of his life forever.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn was reading in the salon as her husband
entered, but, instead of greeting him with a smile,
according to her wont, she went on with her paper,
and did not even glance his way. He glided behind her,
placed his hands round her slender throat, and drew her
head back on his breast.</p>

<p>“Well, Gwen,” he said, trying to look into her eyes.
“What is it, my love?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she answered, with an air of assumed indifference.
“I had a bad headache this morning.”</p>

<p>“No wonder, as you cried yourself to sleep.”</p>

<p>She started violently.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Through my eyes and my ears, Gwen.”</p>

<p>She lowered her long lashes, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>“Well,” he added presently, “I am waiting to know
what all this means.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing of the least consequence.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Gwen, anything that causes you tears
must be of the greatest possible consequence to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! women cry for nothing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Some may, but you do not, Gwen. I have not seen
a tear in your eye, until last night, ever since our marriage.”</p>

<p>“I was so happy,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“And you mean to infer that you are no longer so?”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her on the couch, and put his arm
about her waist.</p>

<p>“Gwen,” he said, very gravely, “we are husband and
wife now, and a difference between us would be a terrible
thing. Lovers’ quarrels are light things, and do to
laugh over afterward; but if you are angry with me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Gwen, it can be no laughable matter. I have too much
faith in your love to believe that you would blame me
for nothing, and condemn me unheard, especially as you
promised on our wedding-day that you would never keep
anything from me.”</p>

<p>“Have you kept all your promises?” she asked, half
sadly, half resentfully.</p>

<p>“I hope so, Gwen. If not, you have only to remind me
how and when I have failed to find me eager to atone.”</p>

<p>“You promised,” she sobbed out, “to uphold me always.”</p>

<p>“And have I not done so?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do speak out, Gwen; you are torturing me,” he complained.
“To be accused of a want of loyalty to my wife
and not to be able to defend myself at once is terrible.
What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You spoke to Mrs. O’Hara yesterday, although you
know her to be my enemy, and I am sure you have been
to see her this morning,” she blurted out, at last, half
ashamed, half afraid, and yet resolute withal.</p>

<p>“That is perfectly true as far as it goes,” replied Colonel
Dacre gravely. “I did speak to Mrs. O’Hara yesterday;
it would have been very difficult to pass a woman
I had known so many years without some sign of recognition;
I also went to call upon her this morning, at her
special request.”</p>

<p>Then he briefly gave her a summary of his interview
with Norah, and laid the letter George Belmont had
written to Miss Pindar in Lady Gwendolyn’s lap.</p>

<p>“Read that,” he said, rather coldly. “You seem so
ready to suspect me, Gwen, I am glad to be able to give
you proofs that I am not deceiving you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawrence!” she said reproachfully; and she had
an impulse to put back the letter, saying she required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
no confirmation of his words, but curiosity checked the
generous movement, and she opened and read it instead.</p>

<p>Her face lightened as she perused these lines, which
seemed almost like a message from the grave, and when
she had finished she said eagerly:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Miss Pindar produce this letter before?”</p>

<p>“Because she knew nothing of the post-mortem examination,
and the suspicious circumstances of his death.
She lives in a quiet country place, and seldom sees a
newspaper; and when Mrs. O’Hara wrote to say that her
brother was dead, Miss Pindar was thankful to let well
alone—even tried to persuade herself that he had died
by the visitation of God, after all, and not by his own
hand.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. O’Hara knew that I had been unjustly suspected,
and should have taken care to exonerate me as
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“She has only had the letter in her possession for a
month, she told me, and did not know of its existence
before. She said she meant to send it to Borton Hall
directly she heard of our return there; but our chance
meeting yesterday has saved her the trouble.”</p>

<p>“And where is she going now?”</p>

<p>“Well, she is going to be married—if that is an answer
to your question.”</p>

<p>“To whom?” inquired Lady Gwendolyn, her eyes sparkling.
“Any one I know?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t tell you; but it is a Russian prince.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Lawrence!” exclaimed his wife, melting
altogether now, although the news seemed too good to be
true. “It isn’t, really, the least probable.”</p>

<p>“It is the improbable things that always come to pass,
I find.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she will live abroad?” said Lady Gwendolyn,
with a great affectation of carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mind?” she asked, drawing quite close to
him and speaking coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Why should I mind?”</p>

<p>“You are such old friends.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But, you see, I shall have to cut all my old
friends now, since my wife takes it into her head to be
jealous of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lawrence!”</p>

<p>“It is true, Gwen!”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” she answered, with sudden candor. “I
have never been jealous of any one but Mrs. O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“And why of her, Gwen? We were both free eight
months back, and if we had cared for each other, what
need have hindered our marriage?”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn hung her head.</p>

<p>“I never thought about that.”</p>

<p>“No; my wife took a foolish fancy into her head, and,
instead of doing her best to banish it, allowed it to take
quiet possession of all her thoughts. The consequence
was that I could not shake hands civilly with an old friend
without being supposed to care more for her than the
woman I had sworn to love and cherish before Heaven!
Confess that you have been very absurd, Gwen.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have, Lawrence,” she answered penitently,
as she nestled close to him and laid her head on
his shoulder. “But you may be sure I shall trust you
for the future, for my own sake. I have suffered dreadfully
since yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I know that, and you deserve a severe snubbing; only
I am so weak where you are concerned, that, if I began
to scold, I should end ignominiously by caressing you, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“And what a nice ending, dear.”</p>

<p>Lawrence was only a man, and his wife was very fair;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
so that we may be sure he readily responded to this naive
invitation. But he had a mind to improve the occasion
before he let the subject drop; so he gave her a little
lecture on the terrible result of any want of confidence
between husband and wife; and she was so glad to be
forgiven, that she not only promised all he required, but
even forgot to remind him that he did not always practise
what he preached.</p>

<p>But the Borton mystery had almost faded from her
mind by this time, and, moreover, she thought it better
to “let sleeping dogs lie.”</p>

<p>That was a happy evening, and one Lady Gwendolyn
often looked back upon with longing afterward. They
had tickets for the Opera Comique, but decided at the
last moment that they should be much happier at home;
and, dismissing the carriage, drew their chairs up to the
log fire, and chatted merrily until bedtime.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn did not cry herself to sleep that night,
nor was she troubled by any evil presentiment of coming
trouble. As she seemed tired, Colonel Dacre was careful
not to rouse her when he went to his dressing-room.
But half an hour later he came hurriedly back, with an
open letter in his hand.</p>

<p>“Gwen, darling,” he said, “I am so very sorry, but I
must go to England directly upon urgent business. The
hurried journey would be too much for you, even if I
were able to wait until you got ready; but I shall not be
away more than three or four days, and I am sure you
will not mind being such a short time alone.”</p>

<p>He looked so troubled and anxious that she said at
once:</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is something serious the matter that
you will not tell me.”</p>

<p>“My uncle, Sir Lawrence, is dead!”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” an inward voice prompted her to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>He colored faintly, and a little spasm of pain contracted
his firm lips as he answered:</p>

<p>“Isn’t that enough, Gwen? However, I must not stand
talking here. I have only just time to catch the boat-train.”</p>

<p>He took leave of her hurriedly, but very tenderly,
promising to write to her from Dover, and then caught
up the traveling-bag he had been filling as he talked, and
hurried away; turning back at the door to give her a last
loving glance and smile.</p>

<p>No sooner had she heard his fiacre drive off than she
jumped out of bed with almost a guilty air, and, picking
up a telegram she had seen drop out of his pocket, read
the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Come the moment you receive this. There will be an
exposé if not, as she is very violent and restless. She
says she wants to find her husband, and we have only
been able to keep her quiet by promising that she should
see you to-night.”</p>
</div>

<p>Was her husband indeed lost to her?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FEAR.</p>


<p>Lady Gwendolyn was so stunned by what she had seen,
that for full ten minutes she stood in the center of the
room, with the paper in her hand, not as yet realizing
the misfortune that had befallen her, and yet with a dead
weight at her heart, and such a sense of bitter loss and
desecration, that she felt as if it would be a blessed
thing to die.</p>

<p>Her husband had left her with a kiss, and yet all these
months he had been living a lie. And living it boldly,
although he must have known that chance might betray
him at any moment. And the Nemesis which had been
dogging his steps all that while had at last tracked him
home to his shame and her sorrow. How she pitied herself
as she thought of her great loss, and pictured the
long, lonely future that she must needs pass without
him.</p>

<p>The prospect appalled her so much that she had almost
a mind at the minute to brave the whole world and defy
her own conscience rather than be parted from him, whom
she loved better than life.</p>

<p>And the child that was coming to her. Oh! that was
hardest, after all. To be born to an inheritance of shame;
to come into a world which had no welcome for it; to
see tears always instead of smiles in the eyes which
would have been so fond and proud, but for all this
shame. No wonder Lady Gwendolyn threw herself down
despairingly on the very floor, feeling in her abasement
as if this were the only fitting place for such as she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately Phœbe had stolen in an hour ago, while
her mistress slept, and lighted the fire, otherwise Lady
Gwendolyn would have been chilled to the bone, for
the streets were crisp with frost, and there was a cold,
clear brightness in the air. As it was, she felt so benumbed,
that presently she had to get back into bed to
warm herself, and lay there, calm now, but utterly forlorn,
trying to think.</p>

<p>Phœbe came in after awhile on tiptoe, and was almost
startled at the wild brilliancy of the wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“I fancied you were still asleep, my lady,” she said
cheerfully. “May I get you some tea now?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” answered Lady Gwendolyn, listening
curiously for the sound of her own voice, and surprised
to find that it had much the same tone as usual. “And
be quick, Phœbe, we are going to follow Colonel Dacre
as soon as we can get away.”</p>

<p>Phœbe forgot her manners, and actually stared. Not
an hour ago Colonel Dacre had told her that Lady Gwendolyn
would remain in Paris until he came back to fetch
her, and had bade Phœbe be specially watchful and attentive.
Phœbe had promised readily, being much attached
to her mistress, and on the strength of this recommendation
she ventured to say:</p>

<p>“Surely you won’t travel alone, my lady, in your state
of health? Colonel Dacre said he should be returning
in a few days.”</p>

<p>“He will not be able,” replied Lady Gwendolyn coldly.
“And I dislike being in a hotel without him. How soon
can you get ready?”</p>

<p>“Not before evening, my lady, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, we must travel in the night.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but my lady, it would kill you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I am much stronger than you think, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
with a carriage to ourselves I shall be able to sleep the
whole way. Anyhow, I mean to go, so pray get on as
fast as you can. If you are not ready, I shall be forced
to leave you behind.”</p>

<p>This threat had the desired effect. Phœbe began to
bustle about her valiantly, and soon made visible progress.</p>

<p>But in the middle of her packing, she suddenly appeared
in the salon.</p>

<p>“You forgot to tell me, my lady, what I was to do with
Colonel Dacre’s things.”</p>

<p>“The same as you do with mine, put them into the
boxes.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my lady,” answered Phœbe, and went back
to her work.</p>

<p>By four o’clock that afternoon the boxes were all
packed and corded, the carriage ordered, and everything
ready for their departure by the seven-o’clock train from
the Northern Railway.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn managed to swallow a cutlet, and
drink a couple of glasses of light wine, as a preparation
for the journey; and then she dressed herself, while
Phœbe was down-stairs, fortifying herself against contingencies.</p>

<p>But before leaving the hotel, Lady Gwendolyn put the
telegram which had given her such sorrowful information
into an envelope, directed it to Colonel Dacre, “Hotel
d’Albion,” stamped it, and then put it into her pocketbook,
ready to post in Calais. She thought it explained
everything, without its being necessary for her to add a
single word; and she was too utterly miserable to write.</p>

<p>Neither did she care to blame him, for she remembered,
as the only thing in his extenuation, that she had
given way too weakly at first, and ought never to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
married him until she had thoroughly investigated the
Borton mystery, and made him prove that he was really
free.</p>

<p>But she had been too eager to secure herself a little
happiness, and she had loved him so foolishly. That
was her excuse; and, though it may seem a poor one to
some, there are others who will understand it, and pity
the poor desolate woman, who had found the thing she
had coveted turn to ashes in her mouth, like the apples of
the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>“If there are any letters for you, or monsieur, where
shall we forward them, miladi?” asked the obsequious
manager, as he bowed her to the carriage.</p>

<p>“You had better take care of them for the present,”
she replied. “Colonel Dacre will probably be passing
through Paris in a few days, and will call for them. If
he changes his plans, I will send you my address.”</p>

<p>We may be sure her heart was very full as she passed
through the brilliant streets, where but two days ago she
had walked proudly on her husband’s arm, happy in his
love, and unconscious of a single care. But Phœbe was
opposite her, and she was obliged to assume an indifferent
air. She even pointed out a few objects of interest
to the girl, and bore her martyrdom so finely that the
other never once suspected the real state of the case.</p>

<p>Phœbe tried hard to persuade her mistress to rest a
little while at Dover, for her worn, wan look made the
faithful creature anxious; but Lady Gwendolyn shook
her head.</p>

<p>“She would have plenty of time for rest later,” she
said, with a wistful, far-away look, as if the rest she
longed for was not of this world.</p>

<p>On reaching town in the cold, gray, early morning,
Lady Gwendolyn drove to a quiet little hotel, and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
in spite of herself, she was obliged to let Phœbe put her
to bed, for she was so utterly weary she could scarcely
speak. But mindful of her master’s orders, Phœbe took
the law into her own hands, and made Lady Gwendolyn
take a bowl of hot soup and a glass of wine. She was
passive now from sheer lassitude, and after awhile fell
into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Phœbe sat by her for about an hour, during which
time she never once stirred. And then she began to feel
so drowsy herself, she was glad to remember that Lady
Gwendolyn had told her to go and lie down. Phœbe
was not naturally a heavy sleeper, but then she had been
up all night, and was so dead beat by this time, that no
sooner did her head touch the pillow than she lost count
of everything.</p>

<p>The clock striking roused her, and she sprang off the
bed and rubbed her eyes, glancing anxiously at the hour.</p>

<p>In her dismay she found it was exactly four! Phœbe
smoothed her hair and dress, and darted off to her mistress’
room. Too much shocked at her own neglect to
think of an excuse, she knocked softly at the door, and,
receiving no answer, concluded that Lady Gwendolyn
was still asleep, and ventured to enter. But the room was
empty, and the strangest part of it all was, that Lady
Gwendolyn’s bonnet, and the dark cloak in which she
had traveled, were gone from the place in which Phœbe
had put them. And so also were the muff and gloves, and
minor accessories of her outdoor toilet.</p>

<p>It was difficult to suppose that, after such a fatiguing
journey, and other things taken into account as well, a
delicate person like Lady Gwendolyn would have gone
out into the cold. But as she was not to be found, this
seemed the only feasible solution of the mystery; and
Phœbe went down-stairs to see if she could get any
information on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>In the passage she came upon a very polite waiter, who
was quite willing to tell her all he knew, and even a little
more. He knew the lady at No. 10 had gone out, for he
had fetched her a carriage himself. But after he had
sufficiently admired Phœbe’s black eyes, which had done
great havoc among couriers and valets since she had
been abroad, he did hint that the head chambermaid
would know more about it than he did, as she had been
summoned to the lady’s room, and had brought down the
order for the carriage.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will kindly tell me where to find her,
then?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and fetch her, miss,” answered the obliging
waiter, and vanished, returning presently with rather
a sour-faced woman of forty, whom he introduced as
Miss Smith.</p>

<p>And Miss Smith, who was more amiable than she
looked, was able to give Phœbe all the information she
required, and a message from Lady Gwendolyn to boot,
that she had gone away upon business, and should not,
probably, be back until the evening of the next day.</p>

<p>“And, meantime, miss, she said you was to be sure
and make yourself comfortable, and order whatever you
required,” concluded Miss Smith affably; “and at any
time that you want a little company and change, there’s
a pleasant room down-stairs, where there’s always somebody
in and out, and ready for a chat.”</p>

<p>Phœbe thanked her, and said she would look in later,
and then went back to her room, wondering.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn’s strange conduct suggested a mystery;
but with all the theories Phœbe started, the idea of
any difference between her master and mistress never
once occurred to her. She would have quoted them confidently
anywhere as the most united couple in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>She passed the evening down-stairs, and allowed the
obliging waiter to languish as much as he liked, being
fortified against his seductions by her honest love for a
cousin in the country. But when Miss Smith said slyly:</p>

<p>“Does her ladyship often go off so sudden-like?”</p>

<p>Phœbe drew up her head, and tightened her lips to
answer:</p>

<p>“Ladies like my mistress have calls upon them people
like us can’t understand. The colonel’s uncle has just
died, and left him the title and heaps of money into the
bargain; so, of course, there’s a good deal to do.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” repeated Miss Smith, with an air of
conviction; “only it’s so odd her ladyship didn’t take
you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all—I wasn’t wanted. I dare say the colonel
sent for her in a hurry, and she got too flurried to know
what she was about.”</p>

<p>“But—well, it’s no affair of mine,” observed Miss
Smith; “but I should be sorry to see a fellow creature
took in. Living in a hotel one sees a good deal of life,
and there’s often people coming here who pretend to
be very fine, and aren’t any better than I am, after all.”</p>

<p>It was the obliging waiter’s desertion that prompted
this insinuation; but Phœbe never guessed that her own
bright eyes were at the bottom of the scandal, and drew
herself up with great dignity.</p>

<p>“I am not one of those who take people on trust,” she
said, with her nose well <i>en l’air</i>. “If her ladyship had
not been what she pretended, she wouldn’t have been
troubled with my services. I have never had anything
but good places yet, and have no fancy for coming down
in the world.”</p>

<p>So saying, Phœbe withdrew to her own apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
feeling that she had had the best of it, on the whole;
and, after visiting Lady Gwendolyn’s room to see if by
any chance she had returned as mysteriously as she had
departed, she went to bed, and slept undisturbed until
the morning.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">CONVICTION.</p>


<p>Lady Gwendolyn had come to England with a purpose,
and she proceeded to carry it out as soon as her physical
strength would allow her. She awoke about three o’clock,
much comforted and strengthened by her long sleep, and
was glad to find herself alone. Of course, it was easy
enough to dispose of Phœbe, but she rather preferred not
to have any trouble in the matter.</p>

<p>She breathed freer when she got outside the hotel, but
she took good care to keep her veil down. On reaching
the station, she found she had half an hour to wait for
her train, and so she forced herself to take some refreshment.
She knew that she had need to garner up her
strength if she was to perform the task she had set herself.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when she reached Borton, but, of
course, there were lights in the station; and as all the
officials knew her well, she had to double her precautions.
She ordered a fly, and drove straight to the best
inn in the little town, as she happened to know the proprietor
of “The Chequers” was a newcomer, and had no
knowledge of her personally.</p>

<p>However, he saw in a moment that she was a lady; and
though her small traveling-bag did not look promising,
he received her with great dignity, and showed her at
once to the best rooms in the hotel.</p>

<p>A tidy little maid was sent to wait upon her, and while
she helped to remove her things, Lady Gwendolyn said
carelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“Have you any nice houses in the neighborhood,
Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” answered Mary. “There is Colonel
Dacre’s, ma’am—Borton Hall, it is called.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! is it a fine place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; but not so fine as Lord Teignmouth’s,
which is four miles out of the town.”</p>

<p>“Really! I suppose neither of them is here now?”</p>

<p>And my lady toyed with her ring, and looked languidly
indifferent, although a keen observer might have noticed
that she stopped her very breath to listen for Mary’s
answer.</p>

<p>“My lord is away, ma’am; but I heard this morning
that Colonel Dacre was at the Hall.”</p>

<p>“And his wife, too, I presume?”</p>

<p>“No; she isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Surely. They haven’t been very long married, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Long enough to get tired of each other, ma’am, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped not. But are you sure Colonel
Dacre is here, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, ma’am, for I saw him with my own eyes
last night.”</p>

<p>“But I thought he had come into a title lately, Mary?”</p>

<p>“So he has, ma’am, begging his pardon. It’s Sir
Lawrence he is called now, for I heard master tell the
waiter so. However, whatever he is called, I saw him
last night.”</p>

<p>“You know him, then?”</p>

<p>“I ought to, for I lived at Borton Hall when I was
younger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” said Lady Gwendolyn, beginning to
feel rather uncomfortable. “Then I dare say you know
Lord Teignmouth by sight?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I don’t. I never saw any of the family,”
was the reply; and Lady Gwendolyn breathed freer.</p>

<p>She was wiser now than she had been, and took
care to nurse her strength. Although she hoped and
prayed to die, it must not be just yet—until she was
quite sure she had nothing to live for. She had come
to Borton to learn the truth, and she must be careful
that physical weakness did not stand in the way of her
enlightenment.</p>

<p>So she ordered a chop, and, what is more, ate it, and
then went to bed. The next day she kept very quiet till
about four o’clock, when the day was beginning to draw
in, and then she had a fly brought, paid her bill, and
drove to the entrance of Borton village, where she
alighted from the vehicle, and dismissed the driver, telling
him the house she was going to was close by, and
she should prefer to walk the remaining distance. He
suggested she should have a boy to carry her bag; but
this she declined, saying it was quite light, and she could
manage very well.</p>

<p>It was not quite dark enough for her purpose yet, and
so she lingered about the lanes for half an hour; and
when the skeleton trees were faint shadows only, and a
few lights began to twinkle in the cottage windows, she
took her way slowly to Borton Hall.</p>

<p>She glided through the garden, listening to every
sound, hiding herself quickly if a bare branch creaked
in the wind, or a bird flew across her path. Keeping on
the dark side of the house, she came presently to a side
door, which she tried softly.</p>

<p>Finding it did not yield, she brought a key out of her
pocket, and, inserting it cautiously in the lock, she soon
found herself inside the house.</p>

<p>She knew every corner of it by heart, for her husband
had always been pleased to answer her questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
only too glad to see that she took so much interest in
their home; so she made her way with little difficulty to
the north wing, passing the library on her way, and inhaling
the fragrance of her husband’s cigar.</p>

<p>How little he guessed that she was so near. Perhaps
even his thoughts were with her, as he lay back in his
favorite armchair, with his feet on the fender, and pictured
how pleasant the room would be later, when Gwendolyn
was scorching her face on a low stool at his side.</p>

<p>She had become so much a part of his life, so entirely
necessary to his happiness, that his cigar had not the
right flavor unless she was there to see him smoke it.</p>

<p>Somehow her image was more than ever obtrusive to-night,
and he had to rise and shake himself to get rid of
the painful impression that something was wrong with
her.</p>

<p>“Humbug!” he said to himself angrily. “I should
have heard, of course, if there had been anything wrong.
I told Phœbe she was to telegraph directly if Gwen were
ill. That’s the only disadvantage of being married—a
man doubles his anxieties. But, then, he trebles his
pleasures,” continued Colonel Dacre quickly, afraid lest
he should be disloyal, even unconsciously, to the woman
he loved so much better than himself; “and I wouldn’t
be unmarried again even if they offered me in return perfect
immunity from care or pain for the rest of my
life!”</p>

<p>With this, he lighted another cigar, and then sat
down and wrote a long letter to his wife, telling her that
his uncle’s funeral would take place the next day, at two
o’clock, at Milworth Abbey—where Sir Lawrence had
died—and that he should leave for Paris that night, to
bring her home.</p>

<p>It was a very tender epistle, and the love that was in
his heart breathed out of every line. He told her how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
much he had missed her, and how tame his life seemed
without her, concluding with the playful declaration that,
whatever happened, they would never be parted again, for
those whom Heaven had joined business should not put
asunder even for a day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Gwendolyn had made her way to a
suite of rooms in the next wing. From her husband’s
embarrassed manner when she questioned him about these
she fancied she should find the key to the mystery of his
life there, and her heart trembled within her. A faint
line of light under one of the doors showed that the
rooms were occupied; and, stooping down, she tried to
reconnoiter through the keyhole.</p>

<p>At first she could see nothing, but as her eyes became
accustomed to the narrow tube through which all investigations
had to be made, she perceived a female figure
seated by the fire. The hands were pendent over the
arms of the chair—the whole attitude betokened dejection—although
from the hair and figure of this woman
she was evidently young.</p>

<p>Her face was turned from the door, and Lady Gwendolyn
longed to obtain a glimpse of it, for she felt almost
sure that it belonged to the person whom she had seen
at Borton Hall shortly before her marriage, and who
had declared herself to be Lawrence Dacre’s wife.</p>

<p>She must have knelt there half an hour, and still the
woman did not turn her head. She was growing so
sick and giddy at last that she was obliged to withdraw
from her post of observation and rest.</p>

<p>When she looked again the large, pale, lack-luster
eyes were turned toward the door, and Lady Gwendolyn
recognized her at once.</p>

<p>She had almost decided to go in, confront her, and
insist upon a full explanation, when she heard a step she
knew only too well mounting the stairs, and from a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
instinct stepped back, and concealed herself behind
the heavy curtains of a window behind. She had scarcely
drawn the folds about her, before her husband appeared,
holding a lamp in his hand, which he set down on a little
table, so close to the curtain behind which she was hidden
that she trembled in her shoes.</p>

<p>He took a large key out of his pocket, and turned it
twice in the lock. But it was evident that even with
this he did not feel that his prisoner was safe, for he
had to undraw two bolts before he could gain admittance.</p>

<p>Then he took the lamp and walked in, closing the door
after him. Lady Gwendolyn’s knees shook under her,
and she had a feeling at the moment as if she would
rather not know the truth.</p>

<p>But she conquered this weakness, and knelt down at
the keyhole again, just in time to see Sir Lawrence bend
over the woman and kiss her tenderly.</p>

<p>Then he drew a chair to her side, and Lady Gwendolyn
heard him say, in a coaxing voice:</p>

<p>“You will be glad to get away from here, Mary, dear,
will you not? I have taken a pretty cottage for you in
the country, where you will be able to have a garden,
and grow plenty of flowers and fruit. You will like that,
I am sure?”</p>

<p>“I want to be with my husband,” she answered, in a
voice of stern resentment. “What right have you to
send me out of the way?”</p>

<p>“But, Mary, I have thoroughly explained why what
you want is impossible. And, indeed, it would not be
for your happiness, my poor child.”</p>

<p>“I am not a child, and you treat me shamefully,” she
snapped. “I won’t have a cottage in the country!”</p>

<p>“Then what will you have?” he asked, with admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
patience, although Lady Gwendolyn knew, by the inflection
of his voice, how harassed and weary he was.</p>

<p>“I will have my proper position. A married woman
ought to live with her husband.”</p>

<p>“If she can, Mary.”</p>

<p>“And I can, and will,” she said, after the manner of
a fractious child crying for the moon. “You want to hide
me up, because you are jealous of my beauty, and know
that I never move without a train of admirers; but I’ve
often played you tricks before, and I will play you tricks
again. Wherever you put me, I will run away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary!” was his reproachful exclamation.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me Mary; I hate the name,” she said, her
pale eyes dilating fiercely. “But you always do everything
I don’t want you to do.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I shall try to please you,” he answered, with
gentle gravity. “I wish you would try to understand
that, my dear.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers impressively; but she shook
it off as if it had been a viper. Then suddenly her mood
changed, and she began to whimper.</p>

<p>Nobody cared for her. What did it signify whether
she was living or dead? She would make an end of it
all one of those days, that she would! She hated a cottage
in the country—she hated everything! She would
stamp down the flowers as soon as they put their heads
above ground. It was no use talking to her! And so
on, until Lady Gwendolyn could scarcely wonder that
Sir Lawrence had tried to escape from such an impracticable,
violent person, and began to pity him a little in
her heart.</p>

<p>He waited until the torrent of words had subsided, and
then he said, with as much firmness as gentleness:</p>

<p>“You know it is very wrong to excite yourself in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
way, Mary. I never deny you anything it is right you
should have, and you must try and be a little more reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Pray, are you reasonable?” she said, with a harsh,
mocking laugh. “You cried for the moon when you were
a child.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but, you see, I don’t cry for it now. As
people get older they understand that what they want is
not always attainable or good for them.”</p>

<p>“What a bore you are!” she said rudely; and turned
her back upon him forthwith.</p>

<p>Certainly, with all his faults, Sir Lawrence had his
temper splendidly under control; for he did not even look
annoyed. Perhaps he felt that he had no right to resent
anything she might say, since she could never insult
him half as much as he was injuring her. However this
may be, he was very patient, and tried industriously to
soothe and satisfy her. But Lady Gwendolyn had heard
enough by this time.</p>

<p>She rose from her knees, cold and benumbed, and stole
out of the house where she had thought to reign queen,
in stealth, like a thief. How she got to Borton Station
she could never remember, but she did get there, and,
eventually, to the hotel, where she found Phœbe waiting
for her, and evidently anxious.</p>

<p>“Get me to bed as quickly as you can,” said her mistress
hoarsely; and not another word did she speak.</p>

<p>Phœbe, who did not like her looks, sat beside her for
an hour; and then, as she seemed to be sleeping quietly,
she went to bed. In the morning Lady Gwendolyn was
very pale, but perfectly composed. Motioning Phœbe to
her bedside, she said, with a little tremor in her voice:</p>

<p>“Phœbe, circumstances over which I have no control
force me to leave Sir Lawrence for good. You have behaved
exceedingly well ever since you have been in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
service, and I should like to keep you with me; at the
same time, I should not like to injure your prospects in
any way. I shall live very quietly; I shall not even call
myself by my real name. People will look suspiciously
on me, perhaps; and you will hear their remarks, and
feel annoyed and humiliated at being supposed to live
with a lady whose character will not bear investigation.
This is as certain as sorrow and pain. Are you sufficiently
attached to me to brave it all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” replied Phœbe, without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p>“Then you elect to follow my fortunes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>“You understand, I hope, that I shall not allow you to
presume upon my position, Phœbe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will find that I shall ever try to
do so, my lady,” answered the girl, with simple dignity.
“If I am no worse treated than I have been thus far, I
shall have nothing to complain of; and at any time that
anything in my manner or conduct displeases your ladyship,
you have only to speak, and I will endeavor to alter
it.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn held out her hand to the faithful
creature. She was desolate enough to feel thankful even
for a humble friend like this; and the best service is that
which is dictated by affection as well as by duty.</p>

<p>That afternoon Lady Gwendolyn had a confidential
interview with her solicitor, Mr. Large; gave him a
power-of-attorney to receive her dividends, and then, accompanied
by Phœbe, she left town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A PAINFUL SURPRISE.</p>


<p>Several of Sir Lawrence’s—as we must call him now—new
neighbors had attended the funeral, and his pleasant
but subdued manner impressed them so favorably that
they were ready to give him and his wife a cordial greeting
when they came to live among them.</p>

<p>“We always felt for your uncle,” said old Lord Milworth,
as he shook the young baronet heartily by the
hand; “but, you see, he lived such a secluded life that
we did not know him well enough to miss him. But you
and your beautiful wife will be great acquisitions, Sir
Lawrence, and I hope we shall shortly have the pleasure
of welcoming you to Loamshire.”</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence thanked him in suitable terms, and said
he counted upon bringing Lady Gwendolyn to the Abbey
in the course of a week or so, and this information pleased
the old lord mightily, for he was a great admirer of the
fair sex generally, and of Lady Gwendolyn in particular.
But in spite of all the kind feeling that was shown him,
Sir Lawrence was thankful when he found himself in
the carriage that was to take him to the station. The
Abbey seemed to him full of the gloom of death, and cast
a chill over his warm, eager pulses.</p>

<p>However, once on his way to Paris, he began to recover
himself. When he reached town, he had only
just time to drive from one station to the other, but by
promising the cabman double fare, he managed to catch
his train, and was soon speeding toward Dover, picking
up his spirits gradually as he went along.</p>

<p>He reached Paris at about six o’clock in the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
and drove straight to his hotel. Much as he longed to
see his wife, and clasp her once more in his arms, he
was too unselfish to disturb her at such an early hour,
and, ordering another room, he lay down and tried to
sleep for awhile.</p>

<p>But he found this to be out of the question, and soon
rose and dressed himself.</p>

<p>Precisely as the clock struck nine—not a minute before—he
knocked softly at the door of his wife’s bedroom,
and, receiving no answer, he went in on tiptoe,
enjoying the anticipation of waking her with a kiss.</p>

<p>But a sudden prophetic chill crept over him when he
perceived that the bed was empty. There where he had
last seen his wife’s fresh, flowerlike face was a large
pink <i>edredon</i>, such as Othello might have used to smother
Desdemona.</p>

<p>He tossed it over, thinking that, maybe, she had hidden
herself beneath it in order to give him a little surprise
in her turn; but as there was no sign of her or her belongings
anywhere, he went back into the salon, and
rang the bell, as if he would ring it down.</p>

<p>The garçon came up running. Sir Lawrence asked if
miladi had changed her room, at which Francois stared
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Changed her room?” he repeated. “Why, she is
gone!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Miladi did not say, monsieur; and it was not our affair
to inquire. We thought she had left to join monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Are there any letters for me?” demanded Sir Lawrence,
putting his hand to his heart, as if he had received
a sudden blow.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, there is one for you, and also several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
for miladi. We gave them in charge of the manager
directly they arrived.”</p>

<p>“Fetch them quickly,” answered Sir Lawrence, who
thought he should find something to explain his wife’s
sudden caprice; and he scarcely breathed until the man
came back, bringing with him all the letters Sir Lawrence
had written to his wife, and one in Lady Gwendolyn’s
handwriting addressed to him.</p>

<p>He waited until the garçon had retired, and then he
tore open this last with an eager, tremulous hand.</p>

<p>A letter full of reproaches and accusations would not
have moved him so much as this cruel silence, this cold
abandonment. It is true that the telegram was a full
explanation, and quite accounted for his wife’s sudden
departure, but he had not expected such dignified self-control
in an impulsive girl like Lady Gwendolyn. He
forgot that she had received one of those terrible blows
that alter a woman’s entire nature, and, therefore, it was
useless to seek any precedent for her present course of
conduct.</p>

<p>At first he could hardly realize the full significance of
all that had happened. It seemed so impossible that his
wife had really left him, and yet, the cruel contrast between
his hopes and the chill reality destroyed the last
remnant of his self-control. He buried his face in his
hands, and the tears rained from his burning eyes. His
whole life was wrapped up in this woman who had deserted
him; and the child that was coming to her was his.</p>

<p>Recovering himself a little, he sat down to ponder as to
the best course to be pursued. He knew it was no use
advertising, because Lady Gwendolyn had often told him
that this would be an unnecessary exposure so far as she
was concerned, as she never read a newspaper. How,
then, could he get at her? Suddenly, as if by inspiration,
it occurred to him that his wife must have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
her solicitor into her confidence, as he received her rents,
and would have to keep her supplied with money. He did
not know Mr. Large’s address, but he felt sure that his
own man of business would, as he had had to communicate
with the other at the time of Lady Gwendolyn’s
marriage.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir Lawrence made up his mind to return
at once to London; and, as he lost no time, he found himself
back again that night—too late, however, to call upon
Mr. Browne.</p>

<p>He passed a miserable night, and was only too thankful
when it was time to start for Mr. Browne’s office
with a reasonable hope of finding him there. Mr. Browne
looked very much surprised when he heard Sir Lawrence’s
errand.</p>

<p>“Surely her ladyship has not forgotten,” he said. “She
must often have occasion to communicate with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it is I who want to communicate with Mr.
Large,” responded his client; “and Lady Gwendolyn is
not with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” replied Mr. Browne, quite satisfied. “I
do not remember Mr. Large’s address at this moment, but
I will look through my books, and tell you directly. I
hope her ladyship is quite well?” he concluded, as he began
to turn over the leaves of a small manuscript book,
stopping when he came to the letter “L,” which headed
one of the pages.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, thank you,” replied Sir Lawrence hesitatingly;
but Mr. Browne did not hear.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he said at last; “Throgmorton Street,
Danesbury Square, number ten.”</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence rose at once, thanked him politely, and
hurried off. He had to wait half an hour at the office
before Mr. Large arrived, and was beginning to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
very impatient, when that gentleman suddenly appeared
before him.</p>

<p>“I must apologize for keeping you waiting,” he said,
with a courteous bow; “but I had to see a client at his
own house this morning, and have not even had time to
breakfast yet. Can I be of any use to you, Sir Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“You certainly can, Mr. Large. I suppose we shall be
private here?”</p>

<p>“Quite so. My clerks would not disturb me themselves,
or allow any one else to disturb me when I am
busy.”</p>

<p>“And they cannot overhear what we say?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly not.”</p>

<p>In spite of this assurance, Sir Lawrence looked cautiously
about him before he began, in a low voice:</p>

<p>“You know, of course, Mr. Large, that my wife has
left me?”</p>

<p>Mr. Large bowed. He had no need to deny this.</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence went on:</p>

<p>“I must tell you that she has made a great mistake,
Mr. Large. If I deserved such treatment at her hands
I should only be too glad, naturally, to let matters remain
as they are, and regain my liberty; but she has judged
too hastily and superficially. I could explain things to
her perfect satisfaction if she would grant me an interview,
and I came here on purpose to ask you to tell her
this, as she has left me no way of communicating this to
her myself.”</p>

<p>“I would willingly do what you ask, Sir Lawrence,”
Mr. Large replied, “but Lady Gwendolyn has not at present
given me any address. She took with her a check
for three hundred and twenty pounds, being her half-year’s
rent and dividends, and said, as she had not yet
decided where to go, she would write to me later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“What did she give as her reason for such an extraordinary
step?”</p>

<p>“She gave no reason.”</p>

<p>“You astonish me!” exclaimed Sir Lawrence vehemently.
“I fancied she would have accused me, in order
to excuse herself.”</p>

<p>“Then you will pardon me for saying that you do not
understand Lady Gwendolyn. If impulsive, she is very
generous, and rather sought to take the blame of your
separation upon herself. I remember her very words:
‘You know I am a spoiled child, Mr. Large, and very
difficult to please. I expected so much that I was sure
to be disappointed, and, therefore, have no right to complain.
Pray let us keep the affair as quiet as we can.’
I reminded her that her friends would demand some explanation
of her conduct; but she assured me that she
was perfectly independent in every way, and had no
intention of consulting anybody. Of course, I knew nothing
of her ladyship’s motives, and had no right to interfere.
I am only surprised that she allowed me to say as
much as I did.”</p>

<p>“Did she look ill, Mr. Large?”</p>

<p>“Extremely ill—so ill that I took the liberty of advising
her to keep within reach of good medical advice.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?” inquired Sir Lawrence
eagerly.</p>

<p>“She said she had had a long journey, and a trying
time mentally; but that she should, no doubt, be all right
when she got into the country.”</p>

<p>“Got into the country?” repeated Sir Lawrence, welcoming
the hint eagerly. “She did not mention Turoy, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did. She told me that her old nurse, Hannah,
would not be able to take care of it any longer as
her husband had obtained a good situation at Westhampstead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
and, therefore, she should like the house let
if I could get her a respectable tenant.”</p>

<p>“Should you consider me a respectable tenant?” inquired
Sir Lawrence, with a faint, trembling smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Large seemed amused.</p>

<p>“Would you care to have the Grange?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I should. I could not bear a stranger there
where my wife passed so many happy months when she
was a child; moreover, I think that Lady Gwendolyn
ought not to be living on six or seven hundred a year
when I have thirty thousand, and I suppose she will not
allow me to help her in any other way.”</p>

<p>“But, you see, Sir Lawrence, her ladyship knows that
the Grange is only worth about eighty or ninety pounds
a year; and if I were to offer her a fancy rent, she would
immediately suspect something wrong.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be wrong for a man to support his wife. I
wish, with all my heart, that Lady Gwendolyn had not a
farthing, and then it would have been difficult for her to
leave me, unless she had the law on her side.”</p>

<p>“I infer, from what she says, Sir Lawrence, that she
considers herself to have the law on her side, but does
not care to appeal to it.”</p>

<p>“I wish she would, with all my heart. The only
thing I ask is an opportunity of explaining matters, and
clearing myself. I should never have condemned her
without proof.”</p>

<p>“When I begged her ladyship to reflect before she took
a step that she might regret so much later, and mentioned
how deceitful appearances often were, she told me that
she had the fullest proof, and must needs believe her
own eyes and ears.”</p>

<p>“Her own eyes!” repeated Sir Lawrence. “But she
came straight from Paris here, I presume?”</p>

<p>“I do not know if am doing right, Sir Lawrence, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
I cannot help telling you that when her ladyship came
to me she had just returned from Borton, and not from
Paris.”</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence became frightfully pale. He understood
it all now.</p>

<p>“Then I am undone,” he said. “What my wife saw
there she would certainly misconstrue, and she has left
me no chance of explaining matters.”</p>

<p>For a minute his courage gave way utterly, and he
buried his face in his hands, and trembled from head
to foot with the effort he made to command himself.</p>

<p class="center">A COTTAGE BY THE SEA.</p>


<p>All Mr. Large’s sympathies had been with Lady Gwendolyn
at starting; but now he began to think there might
possibly be another side to the question. He knew Lady
Gwendolyn was naturally impulsive—and legal men generally
look upon impulsiveness as a fault, or, at best, an
inconvenient quality which stands in the way of anything
like calm, dispassionate judgment. Of course she
had seen and heard something, since she said so; but then
“trifles light as air are, to the jealous, confirmation strong
as proofs of holy writ,” and a person who jumps to conclusions
is not to be trusted in any way.</p>

<p>He felt for this girl more than a lawyer’s interest in
his client, for he had known her since she was a child.
He could not bear that she should throw away her happiness,
and, therefore, when Sir Lawrence said:</p>

<p>“If I write a letter to my wife, explaining matters
fully, will you forward it to her as soon as you know
her address, Mr. Large?”</p>

<p>He answered readily:</p>

<p>“With great pleasure, Sir Lawrence. She did not forbid
me to do that.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t detain you any longer just now,” said
Sir Lawrence. “I am exceedingly obliged to you for befriending
me, Mr. Large,” he added, with a sad smile;
“and I do assure you, on my honor as a gentleman, that
I am perfectly guiltless of any offense toward my wife.
Where I have sinned is against Heaven, in setting myself
up an earthly idol, and for this I am being punished
deservedly now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>His tone was one of deep emotion and unmistakable
sincerity. Mr. Large could not help saying:</p>

<p>“I will do the best I can for you, Sir Lawrence; but I
am afraid you will need all your patience. Her ladyship
gave me to understand that she should not write to
me until she wanted money, and as she is supposed to
have her half-year’s allowance with her, that will not be
yet.”</p>

<p>“My only hope is that not being accustomed to economize,
she will find her income insufficient. She has been
accustomed to spend more than she has now upon her
dress and charities, and will, I am sure, find it very difficult
to make both ends meet now. Excuse me for dwelling
on this possibility; but it is my one hope.”</p>

<p>“Then it is not to be wondered you should dwell on it,
under the circumstances,” replied Mr. Large. “But may
I venture to ask, Sir Lawrence, what your present plans
are?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I shall remain in London, in order that
I may be on the spot whenever you have any news for me.
But I do not mean any of my friends to know of my
whereabouts, and I shall not show myself either at Borton
or Milworth until Lady Gwendolyn returns to me.
In this way I hope to shield her from remark, and make
it easier for her to take up her married life again without
awkwardness or pain. We have been abroad for six
months—let the world suppose we are still there.”</p>

<p>“I think you are quite right,” Mr. Large said; “and I
feel sure that your consideration will touch Lady Gwendolyn
when she comes to her senses. You will bring me
your letter soon, Sir Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow you may count upon it,” he answered;
and then, with a polite apology for having taken up so
much of the other’s time, Sir Lawrence departed.</p>

<p>The next day he took the letter to Mr. Large’s office,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and put it into the worthy lawyer’s own hand. Then he
went back to his solitary lodgings, to wait for the moment
when his wife should repent of her hasty desertion, and
come back to him timidly, humbly, to find such a generous
pardon ready for her, that she would never dream of
leaving him again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I am sorry I came to the seaside now,” said Lady
Gwendolyn languidly, to her faithful abigail, one morning;
“the wind kept me awake all night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady, it does sound dolesome,” answered
Phœbe. “They say there haven’t been such gales for
years. A ship was wrecked close to the pier last night,
and three poor souls drowned within sight of the coastguard.”</p>

<p>“And could nothing be done to help them?” inquired
Lady Gwendolyn, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“No, my lady. The sea was running so high the life-boat
couldn’t get out. It makes me feel quite sad to live
where such things are always happening.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Phœbe, you exaggerate,” exclaimed her
mistress, almost sharply. “This is the first shipwreck we
have had since we came here.”</p>

<p>“But if we are to have one every three months, it will
be cheerful, my lady,” answered Phœbe, who did not
wish to make the best of the present state of affairs,
and thought it very foolish of Lady Gwendolyn to live
in a little cottage by the sea, with a couple of women servants
to wait upon her, when she might have the run of
two mansions, and twenty dependents at least.</p>

<p>And it was terribly dull at Wintertown. Phœbe had
been accustomed to a good deal of change, and not a
soul came near Cliff Cottage, except the clergyman of
the parish, and he never brought his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn received him because his visits comforted
her, and, moreover, she knew that he was too
much of a gentleman to pry into her affairs, but she
never allowed him to suppose that she was other than
what she called herself—Mrs. St. Maur.</p>

<p>Her beauty and aristocratic air made her an object of
great curiosity in Wintertown, and, of course, the women
were all against her, and felt sure that her seclusion was
the cover for some disgraceful secret; but what did all this
matter to her?</p>

<p>She believed that she was doing right at the sacrifice of
all her earthly happiness, and when her heart yearned
with a great yearning toward her husband, she knelt
down and prayed wildly not to be delivered into temptation,
but to have strength to endure even to the end.</p>

<p>One night, just as the earth was beginning to grow
green again, and primrose and violets were sweetening
the hedgerows, Lady Gwendolyn, only half-conscious still,
came stupefied out of her hour of anguish to find a
little face nestling against her bosom, and to hear with
deep thankfulness that a man child was born into the
world, and born to her.</p>

<p>Coming back to life herself from the very edge of the
grave, the joy of maternity swallowed up the recollection
of past peril, and she thrilled through her whole being
as she pressed her white lips to the soft, wrinkled cheek.</p>

<p>“I never saw a bonnier babe, ma’am,” said the nurse
cheerfully. “How proud his poor pa would be of him if
he could see him.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn shivered, and her joy was poisoned
in a moment. This child belonged to her husband as
well as to herself, and how could she ever look at it
without being reminded of the saddest page in her life—of
the wrong and treachery that had made her future
a blank. The boy had his father’s deep blue eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
when they began to open fuller, Lady Gwendolyn had a
strange fancy that they reproached her, and would turn
uneasily away.</p>

<p>Was it possible that she had been too hasty? She had,
of course, done right to leave Sir Lawrence, but she
might have written and explained her motives, and
given him a chance of excusing himself, for her own
sake. In trying to punish him, she had left herself
without any comfort, and the position was irretrievable
now, since, if she showed any signs of relenting, he would
imagine that she was ready to condone the past, and live
with him, anyhow, rather than not live with him at all.</p>

<p>The boy was a month old before Lady Gwendolyn began
to recover her strength, and, meanwhile, her expenses
were very large. Doctors and nurses cost money,
and the young mother’s extreme delicacy made economy
out of the question for the present. Then, in her maternal
pride, she was apt to forget that Master Lawrence
was not heir to Milworth Abbey and Borton Hall, and
indulged in extravagances her income would not stand.</p>

<p>Keeping no accounts, she did not realize, indeed, what
she was spending, and was horrified one day, when, in
looking in what she called her reserve purse, she found
that it only contained five pounds.</p>

<p>And it wanted a month yet of dividend day. What
was to be done? She had been in the habit of paying
ready money for everything, and did not even know that
she could obtain credit in the town, neither would her
pride allow her to ask it.</p>

<p>She had left all her jewels in Mr. Large’s charge, otherwise
she would have sacrificed a diamond ornament, and
taken care to be more careful for the future. But under
present circumstances this was out of the question, and
meanwhile she must have sufficient to pay her weekly
bills. She pondered the question anxiously all night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
and by morning she had come to the conclusion that
there was no help for it, and she must write to Mr. Large.</p>

<p>This was a sore humiliation to Lady Gwendolyn, the
more so that Mr. Large had seemed to think she would
not be able to manage on her income, having been accustomed
to such lavish expenditure, and she had assured
him that she intended to make it do, and had taken rather
a lofty tone on the occasion. But it was better to eat
humble pie than to run into debt, in a place where her
only claim to consideration was the punctuality of her
payments; so she put her pride in her pocket, and wrote
off to Mr. Large, saying that her expenses had been
much greater than she had anticipated of late, that she
must ask him to advance her fifty pounds, and deduct
them from her dividends when they became due.</p>

<p>Directly this letter was despatched, Lady Gwendolyn
felt easier in her mind, although the effort it had cost
her to write it had made her quite ill.</p>

<p>“And if I am embarrassed now,” she said to herself
grimly, “what will it be when baby gets a big boy, and
wants educating, and all that sort of thing? I haven’t
even a rich maiden aunt to leave me money, and I have
always heard that boys are expensive things to bring up.
If we were in our right position now——But I will
not think of that, since it is so impossible,” she added
quickly. “I must do my best, and trust all the rest to
Providence. I have heard of people who lived upon even
less than six hundred a year, and now that I always dress
in black, my clothes won’t cost me much.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">SIR LAWRENCE ACTS.</p>


<p>Sir Lawrence Dacre was just stepping out of Mr.
Large’s house, his head erect, his eyes shining, his whole
face transformed, looking as a man might who has just
received some very joyful tidings, when he suddenly felt
a heavy hand on his shoulder, and, turning, found himself
face to face with Lord Teignmouth.</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence’s face changed again, and he drew a
little away from his former friend. He could not forget
Reginald’s cruel desertion of his young sister, and was
not inclined to encourage his advances under the circumstances.</p>

<p>But when he scrutinized him closer, Lord Teignmouth
looked so thoroughly miserable and ill, that he could not
help relenting a little and allowing him to walk along by
his side.</p>

<p>“Where are you going now?” inquired the earl presently.
“I want to have a little confidential talk with you,
and should prefer to get out of the streets.”</p>

<p>“I am going to my lodgings,” replied Sir Lawrence;
“but I have not much time to spare, as I leave for the
country this evening.”</p>

<p>“Is Gwen here with you? I have been making inquiries
in every direction, and couldn’t hear anything
about either of you; so I imagined you were still abroad.”</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence colored, and said evasively:</p>

<p>“We were abroad for some time, but my wife is at the
seaside at present with our boy. I hope we shall be
settling down now. I begin to long after home.”</p>

<p>“I never heard anything about your boy’s birth,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Lord Teignmouth, in a surprised tone; “and when you
consider that he is heir to two estates, and an earldom
into the bargain, it would have been natural to herald
his birth with a flourish of trumpets.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean heir to an earldom?” said Sir
Lawrence.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when we get inside,” replied Lord Teignmouth
grimly; and he did not speak again until they
were alone at Sir Lawrence’s rooms, and the other had
assured him there was no fear of interruption. Then
he said coolly and abruptly:</p>

<p>“Pauline has run away from me.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed the young baronet.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because she liked somebody else better, I suppose,”
continued Lord Teignmouth, with assumed carelessness.
“There is no answering for a woman’s fancies. Her accursed
vanity makes her such an easy prey that you may
always be sure she will run away from you sooner or
later if any one takes the trouble to tempt her.”</p>

<p>“She would find it a perilous pastime if she belonged
to me,” returned Sir Lawrence, with gleaming eyes,
“unless she ran away alone.”</p>

<p>The earl shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</p>

<p>“It is much better to be philosophical. Besides, Pauline
has been deceiving me for years, and I feel as if I
am well rid of such a woman on any terms.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“In this wise. Pauline went to the Newburg masked
ball, and I went to bed. The next morning about noon
I had occasion to speak to my lady about a large dressmaker’s
bill that had just come in, and went to look for
her up-stairs. To my surprise I found that she had not
been home at all that night. Of course I rang for her
maid, and asked if she knew where her mistress was;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
but Julie was evidently as ignorant of her whereabouts as
I was. She fancied that my lady was ill, as she did not
return, she said; but when we came to look about us
we found that she had taken her jewel-case with her,
which gave her absence rather a suspicious air.”</p>

<p>“And there was no letter?”</p>

<p>“Not until the second post, and then I was honored
with a somewhat voluminous epistle informing me in
the politest way possible that I was an unsympathetic
brute, with whom it was impossible for a woman with
any natural sensibility to be happy, and finally that she
had found some one to really care for, and believed that
the future would compensate for the past.”</p>

<p>“Confoundedly cool!” exclaimed Sir Lawrence, apparently
more moved than the earl himself.</p>

<p>“Or, rather, well put. Women of Pauline’s caliber are
always insolent, unless you make them fear you; and that
sort of thing was never in my line.”</p>

<p>“With whom is she gone? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I saw it in the <i>Court Chronicle</i>. The man
whom she thinks able to sympathize with a sensitive,
tender creature is a Russian—Prince Czarski—and is
married to a handsome Irish woman, whose husband,
Jack O’Hara, was in your regiment, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Poor Norah! Her second venture was not a very
fortunate one, then. What could she have been thinking
of when she married that man?”</p>

<p>“Of pin-money, I suppose, like all women,” answered
Lord Teignmouth cynically; “and from that point of
view she has done very well. I heard yesterday that she
has taken Lady Gorman’s house, in Mayfair, for the
season; so that she must be pretty well provided for.
Have you any soda and brandy in the house?” he concluded
abruptly, as he leaned back in his chair and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
passed his hand over his damp forehead. “This sort of
thing is very upsetting, even when you are a philosopher.”</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence rang, and ordered what he required; and
when Lord Teignmouth had drunk off a tumbler of the
mixture, he went on gravely:</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, my wife has played a part all along.
You remember that Belmont affair?”</p>

<p>“Quite well,” answered Sir Lawrence, who thought he
knew what was coming.</p>

<p>“Well, she was to blame there, and not poor Gwen,
after all, it seems. Belmont had been her lover before
even she married me, and she corresponded with and met
him secretly. If he had been as rich as the Russian
prince, she would probably have sympathized with him
to the same extent; but his poverty stood in the way of
his preferment,” added the earl, with, a bitter laugh. “I
am sorry she fooled me so completely; but Gwen is a
generous soul, and knows how helpless men are in the
hands of artful, designing women, so that, perhaps, she
will forgive me, if you ask her. Tell her Pauline has
done her one good turn, anyhow—she has made her boy
my heir presumptive to the earldom of Teignmouth.”</p>

<p>“But surely you will get a divorce and marry again?”</p>

<p>“I shall get a divorce, probably; but I shall never
marry again. ‘Once bit, twice shy,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me who enlightened you about
that affair of Belmont’s?”</p>

<p>“Not at all; it was the princess—Mrs. O’Hara that
was. She naturally felt indignant when she missed her
spouse in the morning, too, and found out that my wife
had wronged her doubly by running off with her husband.
I don’t really think human nature could bear this
tamely; and she came to me at once with her brother’s
last letter, and also several written to him by Lady
Teignmouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Poor Norah! Was she much troubled?”</p>

<p>“She was more angry than hurt, I really believe; and
seemed comforted by the thought that she was well provided
for, pecuniarily speaking. I fancy she had caught
a Tartar, and was not sorry, on the whole, to be rid of
him.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case, he will avenge your wrongs.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; it generally happens so. But I think we
have given more time to this subject than it deserves—don’t
you? When are you going to join Gwen?”</p>

<p>“To-night.”</p>

<p>“Then I may as well go with you, and make my peace
with her, and be introduced to my heir—unless you have
any objection?”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to have you, and so will Gwen,
I am sure; for she is, as you say, a generous soul. But,
if you would not mind, I should much rather you followed
me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well; just as you like,” he answered, lighting
a cigar. “Perhaps it would be better, as you can explain
matters before I come. Somehow, I don’t want
to talk of that unhappy business of mine more than I
am quite obliged.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Sir Lawrence, and glanced at the
clock. “I must go now,” he added, “or I shall miss my
train. There’s Gwen’s address, and we shall expect you
some time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Lord Teignmouth; and the two
parted with a cordial hand-shake. One was too happy,
the other too miserable, to bear malice.</p>

<p>It was dusk when Sir Lawrence arrived at Wintertown.
He took a fly, told the man to drive him to within
a few doors of Lady Gwendolyn’s cottage, then jumped
out and made his way to the house under cover of the
darkness. Opening the door cautiously, he stole in to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
find himself face to face with Phœbe, who was just going
to light the hall lamp.</p>

<p>She was so surprised that the candle she was holding
dropped out of her hand, and for one anxious moment he
thought she was going to scream and spoil all. But
Phœbe was quite as glad to see him as he was to be
there, and so, having recovered herself a little, she beckoned
him, with a confidential air, into the dining-room,
and said, under her breath:</p>

<p>“My lady is asleep, sir. Shall I go and tell her you
are here?”</p>

<p>“Not for the world,” replied Sir Lawrence, who
thought it would be pleasant to act the prince in the
fairy tale, and wake his sleeping beauty with a kiss. But
he stayed for a minute to ask Phœbe a few questions.</p>

<p>“Is your mistress quite well?”</p>

<p>“As well as any one can be who is always worrying
and fretting, sir.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon alter that, Phœbe. There has been a miserable
mistake, and I had no chance of explaining. But
you may begin to pack up—we shall all be off to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p>“Shall we, indeed, sir?” exclaimed Phœbe joyfully.
“I hope everybody will know who my mistress really is
now, sir; for it wasn’t pleasant to see her looked down
upon, who was so much better than all of them, and she
wouldn’t even let me call her ‘my lady’ before the other
servants.”</p>

<p>“What name did they know her by, then?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. St. Maur.”</p>

<p>“Has she had no friends in Wintertown?”</p>

<p>“Not one, sir. The clergyman of the parish came occasionally——”</p>

<p>“And his wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because people misdoubted my lady’s being married
at all, sir. You see, it did look odd her being here without
any one to speak for her, as it were.”</p>

<p>“It was a miserable pity,” he said passionately. “But
it is no use talking about it now, Phœbe.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the faithful girl, beginning to
whimper; “only it has been a sad trial for me, who
knew that my mistress merited the attention and respect
she did not get. But come what may, she is a deal too
handsome ever to have the women on her side.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care they are civil to her, anyhow,” replied
Sir Lawrence, with a very determined air, as he nodded
kindly to Phœbe, and then went to his wife.</p>

<p>He had not the heart to wake her just yet, she slept
so peacefully; and yet, when the fire blazed up for a
moment, and he could see her face plainly, he thought
it looked pale and worn.</p>

<p>As for the child—he was glad and proud to have a
son, but it was very difficult to think of him when his
mother was by. He took just one peep at the face
crushed against Lady Gwendolyn’s bosom, and then he
sat down on the couch at his wife’s side, and gradually
insinuated his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>As she did not rouse he grew bolder, and presently
her head was resting on his shoulder, as naturally as
if there had been no break in their tender union. To
listen to her soft breathing was happiness enough for
awhile, but at last he began to weary for the sound of
her voice—the touch of her sweet lips.</p>

<p>“Only that if I wake her, the child will wake, too, and
then he’ll cry, as a matter of course,” thought Sir Lawrence,
whose experience of babies so far had not prejudiced
him in their favor. “I suppose I must wait.”</p>

<p>He was very patient for about five minutes, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
the soft, white cheek on his shoulder tempted him beyond
his strength, and he bent down and kissed it with
more vehemence than he realized.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn stirred, then, and it seemed as if she
had been dreaming of him, for his name rose to her lips,
and as he drew her closer, baby and all, she opened her
eyes quite wide, put up her lips to be kissed like a child,
and said, very softly:</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come, papa; baby and I were
wanting you badly.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A LONG EXPLANATION.</p>


<p>“Well, my love,” said Sir Lawrence, when the first rapture
of reunion was over, and his wife was leaning languidly
against him, like one faint with too much joy, “are
you going to take me on trust now, after having shown
such poor faith in me hitherto?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a shy smile.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will tell me of your own accord what
it is right I should know.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; and I only regret, dear Gwen, that I was
so foolishly sensitive in the beginning as to withhold it.
But there are some things it is so hard to tell.”</p>

<p>“Then keep silent, Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“No, darling; you and I will never have any disguises
for the future. The poor unhappy woman you saw at
Borton Hall was my only sister.”</p>

<p>“Your sister? Oh, Lawrence! can you ever forgive
me?” she exclaimed penitently.</p>

<p>“I think I can, if I try very hard,” he answered, with
a smile. “And I must own that appearances were sadly
against me. But it is a very painful story, Gwen. Poor
Mary was married at eighteen to a man she loved with
all her heart; and though she began to change from that
very day, she was so loyal I never once suspected her
secret. But two years after her marriage her mind
gave way altogether, and then, for the first time, I discovered
that her brutal husband had subjected her to
every kind of ill-usage and degradation. She was even
scarred by his blows, poor soul! and such a wreck! My
very blood runs cold when I think of it. I placed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
with a doctor, who was very skilful in the treatment of
mental disorders; and, after awhile, she seemed to mend
a little, although she had extraordinary and painful delusions,
and was so restless that it was impossible to lose
sight of her for a moment. In one of these fits she
actually came to Borton on foot, and must have wandered
about the house, since you saw her.”</p>

<p>“She came into the room where I was, and asked me
if I had seen her husband.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. That was one of the most distressing phases
of her malady, to my mind: that she was always wanting
her husband, and seemed to think me so cruel in
keeping her away from him. Her mind was so completely
gone that she had no recollection of his ill-usage;
and, although this was well for some reasons, it made
a good many difficulties. But she could never have
actually mentioned me by name when she spoke of her
husband?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I jumped to conclusions a little,” replied
Lady Gwendolyn contritely. “Now I know the
truth, I see I might have put a different construction on
her words.”</p>

<p>Then she told him about her journey to Borton, and
how she had received there what she believed to be a full
confirmation of her fears. Sir Lawrence was glad she
had not condemned him without what seemed to her
good proof, although he could hardly understand where
a delicate young creature like Lady Gwendolyn had
found the courage for such a task.</p>

<p>“And so ill as you were, too, at the time,” he said
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes; but the hope of seeing or hearing something that
would exonerate you made me valiant, Lawrence. I determined
to make ‘assurance doubly sure’ before I left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
you for good, because—because I did want to stay with
you so badly.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you?” he asked, just to try her.
“Even I should not have known that you were compromising
with your conscience in so doing, if you had
burned the paper you had picked up, and said nothing
about it.”</p>

<p>“That is true; but I could never have kept it to myself;
and, what is more, I should have been utterly miserable,
especially after baby’s birth.”</p>

<p>“Why more especially after baby’s birth?”</p>

<p>“Because, if it had all come out one of these days, he
would not have had a very high opinion of his mother;
and, of course, I want baby to respect me.”</p>

<p>She said this with a little air of matronly dignity that
was fine to see, and amused and touched him equally.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care Master Baby is brought up to think
there never was such a woman as his mother,” he said,
smiling. “Boys always imitate their fathers.”</p>

<p>“Do they? I’m so glad!” she answered naïvely. “But,
Lawrence, tell me who was it sent you that telegram in
Paris?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman with whom poor Mary was living.”</p>

<p>“And where is she now?”</p>

<p>“Dead, poor heart!” he replied solemnly and feelingly.
“She left Mr. Jepherson’s house the last time she came
to Borton very insufficiently clad, and traveled one whole
night. The consequence was that she caught a cold,
which settled on her lungs, and only lingered three weeks.
I loved her very dearly; but I cannot regret her, Gwen.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was just an instinct that made her always
take refuge at Borton.”</p>

<p>“She knew that I had been mixed up in some way in
separating her from her scoundrel of a husband, and
this gave her the notion that I was keeping them apart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
I could not make her realize any part of the past that
would hinder her from dwelling on this one idea. All
her other delusions changed; but that was a steady, fixed
conviction that all the reasoning in the world would not
alter. Her last words were: ‘I am going to my husband,
now, in spite of you all.’ And it was strange,
Gwen; but Captain Lowe died the very day before she
did, so that, perhaps, who can tell? they did meet again in
another world.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn’s face was very sad now as she leaned
against her husband’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Poor Mary! what a miserable fate; and she looked
so young still.”</p>

<p>“Four-and-twenty. I will show you her grave when
we go to Borton.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me, if you would rather not, Lawrence, but
I should like to know why you kept this such a profound
secret?”</p>

<p>“Because people believed her to be dead, and it seemed
to me better so. Captain Lowe would have claimed her
directly, if he fancied there was anything to be gained
by it. As it was, he often tried to exact money from me.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you might have confided in me,” she said
half reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I was so afraid that my love for you would make
me disloyal to poor Mary, and then, if a mere inkling of
the truth had come out, Captain Lowe would have left me
no peace of my life.”</p>

<p>“But after we were married you knew I could be
trusted, Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“If you had questioned me then, I should have told
you all; but as you did not do so, I was glad to leave well
alone.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have liked me to have any secret from
you, Lawrence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“No, my love, that is true; at the same time, you
must remember that you might have had half a dozen
mad relatives, and I should not have known. The fact
is”—and his voice changed—“I was terribly sensitive
about it, Gwen. I was so afraid you would make a
trouble of it, and fancy insanity was hereditary in the
Dacre family. My uncle’s eccentricity would have confirmed
the impression, and the very idea of a possible
fate of this kind for your unborn child would almost
have worried you into your grave.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it would,” she admitted.</p>

<p>“But let us talk of something more cheerful now,
Gwen. Who do you think is coming to see you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Not Mrs. O’Hara?” said Lady Gwendolyn, looking
alarmed.</p>

<p>“A very bad guess. Try again.”</p>

<p>“Pauline?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid! Will you give it up?”</p>

<p>“Is it Beatrice Ponsonby?”</p>

<p>“No again.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then.”</p>

<p>“Your brother, Reginald.”</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolyn changed color.</p>

<p>“Is it worth while?” she asked coldly. “Pauline is sure
to take care that we do not keep friends long, in case we
should compare notes.”</p>

<p>“You may compare notes as long as you like; you cannot
hurt Pauline more than she has hurt herself.”</p>

<p>And Sir Lawrence told his wife the miserable, guilty
story, knowing quite well that the very idea of Reginald’s
being in trouble would make his generous, impulsive little
wife forget her own wrongs in a moment.</p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! poor Reggie, how very shameful and wicked!
How could she?—how could she?” was all Lady Gwendolyn
could say. “She promised me so faithfully she
would be a good wife for the future, if I would not tell
my brother the truth.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps she meant it all the time, Gwen; but
she had got into the habit of these intrigues, and could
not live without the excitement. If she had had children
she might have been a better woman; but she did not
care for Lord Teignmouth from the first, and then he did
leave her too much liberty.”</p>

<p>“I told him so once, but he said that a wife who needed
watching was not worth keeping. Then she always pretended
to be such a prude.”</p>

<p>“She hadn’t that character in the world, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“But Reginald would be the last to hear of that; and
if he had, she would have persuaded him that the women
were jealous of her, and so tried to injure her with
him. An artful woman can so easily manage her husband.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Sir Lawrence, laughing; “that is a
bad lookout for me.”</p>

<p>“I am not artful, sir! How dare you speak in that
way to baby’s mama?”</p>

<p>“I see baby’s mama is a very important person. I only
hope that baby’s papa is not going to be put entirely
aside on his account. I begin to fear lest I have a very
influential rival near the throne. If the boy is to divide
us, instead of drawing us closer together, I shall wish
he had never been born.”</p>

<p>“You dear, foolish man!” she said, understanding perfectly
the jealous feeling that prompted this speech.</p>

<p>Lord Teignmouth looked very shamefaced when he
first presented himself before his sister, but Lady Gwendolyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
soon set him at his ease. She put her arms round
his neck, and said heartily:</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you again, dear old fellow! Don’t
let us talk about anything disagreeable.”</p>

<p>And as he was very glad to be spared, and knew he
should have opportunities of showing what he was not
allowed to say, he gave in at once, and covered his embarrassment
by asking to see “our heir.”</p>

<p>Two days later Sir Lawrence took his wife to Milworth
Abbey, where there were fine rejoicings, we may
be sure. The house had been useless to the neighborhood,
socially speaking, for years, and every one was glad
to welcome a brighter reign.</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence was already known and liked, and Lady
Gwendolyn soon won golden opinions from all sorts of
people. The poor almost worshiped her. As she often
said, since she had lived and nearly lost, she must make
others the happier for her happiness, or perhaps Heaven
would take her blessings from her, and she had so many
now, she had need indeed to be grateful.</p>
